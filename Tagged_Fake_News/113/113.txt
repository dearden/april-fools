Just before the presidential election there seemed to be a new woman coming forward every day claiming to have been sexually harassed by The Donald Trump.

It could also be that there isn't much merit to such claims of abuse. Trump has been in the public eye for long time  – and yet every single one of his accusers waited until within one month of a national election to come forward? They're all aware of how wealthy the man is, and could've come forward years (or in some cases, decades) ago and walked away with nice settlements if their claims were true. The fact that they didn't bother to do so gives me the impression that they're looking for attention – or to sway the election.

Summer Zervos the Ex-Apprentice loser who claimed Donald Trump sexually assaulted her was paid $500,000 by lawyer Gloria Allred to fabricate the story. Allred is a Hillary Clinton collaborator and DNC Assosciate. According to an anonymous source this deal was reportedly shopped around to other ex-Apprentice contestants, which makes sense now.

Everyday for about a week we saw one accuser after another come forth. We must share this to as many people as we can to vindicate Donald Trump.  Zervos' sexual harassment accusation against Trump is a “completely fabricated hoax.” Zervos was paid half a million dollars by Gloria Allred, which is being paid out “slowly over time” .

 Zervos was a big league Trump supporter who converted her whole family to the Trump Train until she met Gloria Allred, as was reported before. Money talks!

Despite an RNC platform that is overwhelmingly anti-gay, Donald Trump in his speech on Thursday mentioned the Orlando massacre and said that he "will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of the hateful, foreign ideology, believe me," in reference to fundamentalist Islamic.

The line was met with loud applause from the presumably conservative crowd and Trump noted, "I have to say, as a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said, thank you."

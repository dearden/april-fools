The Upshot's elections model suggests that Hillary Clinton is favored to win the presidency, based on the latest state and national polls.

The New York Times is one of many news organizations to publish election ratings or forecasts.

We then assume that Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton win the other states in which they are favored. Above all, this diagram illustrates how important Florida and Pennsylvania are to both candidates.

Hillary Clinton has reached the 2,383 delegates today. This is what she needed to win the party nomination for the 2016 Presidential race. She is officially the first woman nominee of a major U.S. political party. The Associated Press released a new count of her pledged delegates and showed that she has reached the magic number.

*** This is an outright lie.

Besides being suspiciously announced right before the California primary tomorrow. A spokesman for Bernie Sanders, Michael Briggs said Monday that the number that was released today depends on superdelegates. This means that this is not an official victory.

“It is unfortunate that the media, in a rush to judgement, are ignoring the Democratic National Committee's clear statement that it is wrong to count the votes of superdelegates before they actually vote at the convention this summer,” he said.

*** What else would you expect from CROOKED Hillary?



Briggs says that Sanders could potentially change the minds of those superdelegates before the Democratic Convention.

“Secretary Clinton does not have and will not have the requisite number of pledged delegates to secure the nomination,” he said. “She will be dependent on superdelegates who do not vote until July 25 and who can change their minds between now and then. They include more than 400 superdelegates who endorsed Secretary Clinton 10 months before the first caucuses and primaries and long before any other candidate was in the race.

“Our job from now until the convention is to convince those superdelegates that Bernie is by far the strongest candidate against Donald Trump.”

The Clinton campaign tweeted the following:

In another recent tweet, Clinton said that “we are on the brink of a historic moment, but we still have work to do.”

We can agree with that statement. We are on a historic moment and Hillary Clinton is about to get SHREDDED by Donald Trump in the worst presidential sweeps in history. (h/t The Blaze)

The Clinton Machine is coming to screeching halt as “27 email chains containing classified information” were found on Anthony Weiner's laptop.

Expect the Congressional Republicans to grill Hillary Clinton, her aides, and the FBI for more information on the contents of the emails.

Fox News reports:

A federal court on Tuesday released the search warrant documents filed by the FBI to access a laptop used by disgraced ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner and his estranged wife, Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, revealing new details about why the bureau revisited the email case just days before the presidential election.

The FBI's investigation found “27 email chains containing classified information” on a laptop that “was never authorized for the storage or transmission of classified or national defense information,” according to the application for the warrant, which was partially redacted.

The October re-opening of the Clinton investigation sprung from an unrelated case involving Weiner allegedly sexting with an underage girl. During the course of that inquiry, agents discovered the joint laptop and later found emails addressed to and sent from Clinton.

It's the end of the line for the Clinton crime machine.

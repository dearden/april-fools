Kicking off a holiday week of meetings at his South Florida estate, President-elect Donald Trump began filling in his Pentagon staff Monday by nominating infantry veteran and New York financier Vincent “Vinnie” Viola as secretary of the Army.

“Whether it is his distinguished military service or highly impressive track record in the world of business, Vinnie has proved throughout his life that he knows how to be a leader and deliver major results in the face of any challenge," Trump said in a statement.

Trump has pledged to increase the size of the nation's armed forces.

Viola, founder and chairman of Virtu Financial and owner of pro hockey's Florida Panthers, said in a statement that, if confirmed by the Senate, "I will work tirelessly to provide our President with the land force he will need to accomplish any mission in support of his National Defense Strategy."

His primary focus, Viola said, "will be ensuring that America's soldiers have the ways and means to fight and win across the full spectrum of conflict."

Trump made the announcement the same day that members of the Electoral College cast their votes for president in state capitals across the country. While anti-Trump groups are urging electors to vote for someone else, electors are expected to ratify the New York businessman's victory in last month's election.

The president-elect is operating from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., where he plans to stay through at least Christmas Day.

As secretary of the Army, Viola would work with retired general James Mattis, whom Trump has nominated to be secretary of Defense.

In its announcement, the Trump transition team said Viola is a West Point graduate and he "will combine a deep background in national security affairs with an impressive track record of leading and managing high-performing teams within the military and the private sector."

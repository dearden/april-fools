Manhattan – Earlier this morning, Trump University issued degrees to 4,500 students online, and drew the attention of national media when the university announced several high-profile recipients of honorary degrees, sources say. Among those to receive honorary degrees, Sarah Palin was offered a honorary doctorate in climate science, a M.D. in advanced neurosurgery, and a PhD in “having total class”.


“We doctors are the shakers and the movers, the pokers and jokers, the wheelin' and the stealin', Obama's been to that mountaintop, that I can tell you…” Palin told a crowd of the stupidest humans alive Saturday morning. “Let's get that Trump Train behind us, in front of us, in our hearts, our minds, our mouths… Get the word of mouth out for Donald!”

Palin has been in the headlines this week after questioning whether or not Bill Nye, “The Science Guy” was in fact an actual scientist.   “Bill Nye is as much a scientist as I am,” Palin said at an event in Washington, D.C according to The Hill.  Palin targeted Nye over his statements on global warming featured in the anti-climate change documentary “Climate Hustle”.

Donald also reportedly offered “one hundred degrees from my university” to John Kasich for his delegates, but the Kasich Camp has not responded to our request for comment, and sources close to the governor say he may be holding out for Vice President.

With the announcment, Palin becomes the first minority to receive the prestigious degree without paying an exorbitant amount.

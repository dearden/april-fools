Michael Reagan is the son of former President Ronald Reagan. He tweeted on Monday that he WILL NOT vote for Donald Trump. He also said that he thinks that his father WOULD NOT have supported Donald Trump.

Reagan said that he would not vote for Trump at the California primary on Tuesday. What a turncoat? You, Michael, are not like your father.

You are not even close to your father, Michael. You are like the Shaquille O’Neil of being worthless. Before the liberals call me a racist for that line or something silly like that, let me clarify. What I mean is that you are the biggest and best at being worthless. Now, you should do like Shaquille O’Neil and retire.

This most likely would be the 1st time if my father was alive that he would not support the nominee of the GOP @Reince @newsmax

Shame on you for calling on the ghost of your father. If you were anything like your father, Michael, you would have done something about the decline of this country.

Where were you Michael Reagan as this country started falling apart? Where were you Michael Reagan when the jobs in this country started disappearing? Why do these so-called Republicans have so much to say, now?

These so-called Republicans need to get on board. You guys aren’t relevant anymore. This isn’t a campaign to make you richer anymore. This is a campaign to make America richer again. We need our jobs.

Michael Reagan is the president of the Reagan Legacy Foundation. He spends his time celebrating his father’s accomplishments and advocates for the issues that Ronald Reagan supported. You are just a legacy leech, Michael.

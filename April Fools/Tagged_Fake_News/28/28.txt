A week after Sarah Palin endorsed Donald Trump for president, the former Alaskan Governor is now endorsing Iowa Caucus winner, Ted Cruz.

Palin told the Alaskan Times, “After deep meditation while hunting me some moose, I decided Ted Cruz is the real man for the job. It’s hard for me to admit, since I’ve only been wrong once or twice in my life, but I have to do the right thing and put my support behind Ted.

“While he might be using tactics, I’m a dirty gal and know what it takes to win. I’m prouder than a duck dating a mongoose to support Ted Cruz.”

We’ll see who wins New Hampshire, though, since “there are a lot of primaries and caucuses left, and I want to pick the winner, so my endorsement will go how the political winds go. I could end up endorsing myself by the time this process is done.”

Trump called Palin an ‘Indian Giver’ after she changed her endorsement and gave it to rival Ted Cruz.

“Is her endorsement even worth anything?” Trump asked supporters at a New Hampshire rally. “First she doomed McCain; then she doomed me in Iowa. I think I’ll stay as far away from that nut job as possible and let Ted deal with the Palin curse. Let me tell you the truth, I didn’t know what the hell she was talking about most of the time. I don’t understand her appeal.”

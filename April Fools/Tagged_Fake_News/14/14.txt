WOW..

Donald Trump has sent the Internet into a frenzy again today by adding a new stipulation for people that come to see him speak at his campaign rally’s and it’s called the “Brown Paper Bag Test”

For those unfamiliar with the brown paper test, it’s where the skin tone of African-Americans were visually measured against an actual brown paper bag; individuals lighter than the bag were labeled with more positive attributes compared to dark skin males and females.

It gained popularity after the abolishment of slavery in 1865 and unconsciously, this test still seems to exists within the black community, especially when it comes to dating. Preference is natural in any aspect of life but within the black community bias stereotypes can fog decisions and lead to unhealthy relationships.

Now Donald Trump has decided to use this test at all future campaign rally’s and if you are not lighter than the brown paper bag you will not gain entry into any of his Pep Rally’s.

Trump released a statement saying:

“IT’S NOT ABOUT BLACK OR WHITE, IT’S ABOUT RICH AND POOR, CLASS AND NO CLASS, WHICH SIDE ARE YOU ON? I’M ON AMERICA’S SIDE AND I WILL MAKE HER GREAT AGAIN”

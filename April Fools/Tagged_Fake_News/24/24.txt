Donald Trump is looking to assemble a strong team of experienced business leaders as he enters into the intense general election phase. While many expected Trump to consider government leaders, he is leaning on long time WWE boss Vincent K. McMahon to serve as his running mate.

Trump and McMahon met for more than two hours earlier today at Trump’s New York headquarters.

This is not the first time Mr. McMahon has been involved in politics. His wife Linda has run for political office on multiple occasions. His experience and notoriety would offer a boost to Donald’s campaign as it enters the toughest battle he has faced thus far.

“Look, Vince McMahon is someone I deeply admire. We had a discussion today and I think he’s the guy. Listen, this is our country’s future. Vince gave us Stone Cold. Vince gave us The Rock. Vince gave us DX. How can you argue with his record? We need this guy. He gave us the Texas Rattlesnake for god sakes.” Trump told reporters after a media event.

For his part, Vince McMahon said he and Trump had a lot in common.

“We both say ‘you’re fired’, we’re both businessmen, we both love wrestling. You know who else loves wrestling? America. You know who hates wrestling? Hilary.” McMahon said, appearing ready for his possible role as VP.

It remains to be seen if or when Trump would confirm the WWE boss as his potential running mate. Experts say it wont be long if they’ve already met.

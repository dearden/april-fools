SAN FRANCISCO, Ca. – While speaking at the F8 developer’s conference in San Francisco this week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled a groundbreaking addition to the popular social media platform that many in the tech industry believe has the potential to revolutionize the American electoral process.

“We’re doing something that’s never been done before,” Zuckerberg declared. “By allowing Americans to utilize Facebook to cast their vote in the upcoming presidential election from anywhere in the world using their desktop or mobile devices, we’re eliminating the conditions for which voter suppression can be implemented.”

In the days leading up to the presidential election, Facebook users will be able to log into their accounts and find the profiles of each candidate prominently displayed at the top of their News Feed. “Users can then cast their vote by Liking their desired candidate’s profile,” Zuckerberg explained before adding, “It’s that simple.”

Kathryn Blair, a senior official with the U.S. Election Assistance Commission – the federal agency which oversees state and national elections – said that Facebook’s revolutionary new voting platform is projected to become a national standard by 2020. “We aim to completely phase out the old-style paper ballots by 2018,” Blair told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. “In a very short time, all elections in the United States will be decided through Facebook.” Ms. Blair later said the EAC is working with Facebook to reduce voter fraud by identifying and eliminating duplicate or otherwise fake accounts.

According to Zuckerberg, the upcoming U.S. presidential election is only the beginning for Facebook’s innovative voting platform. “In the not too distant future, Facebook will determine the outcome of elections all around the world. From the United Kingdom to Pakistan; to Ukraine, the Philippines and Israel,” vowed Zuckerberg. “Wherever democracy thrives, Facebook will be there.”

Russian diplomat Petr Polshikov, 56, has been found dead from gunshot wounds to the head at his flat in Moscow’s Balaklavsky Prospekt, according to local media. Polshikov is a head figure in the Latin American department of the Russian foreign ministry, and served as an ambassador to Bolivia. His murder comes after Russian ambassador to Turkey, Andrei Karlov, was killed by an off-duty police officer at an art gala.

In Polshikov’s shooting, investigators found two empty bullet shells in the diplomat’s flat. A gun was also found in the flat’s bathroom under the sink.

So far, the no murderer or suspects have been apprehended. The reason for the assassination is currently uncertain, as Russian authorities are examining all possible theories and leads to Polshikov’s death. The sole individual at the scene during Polshikov’s murder was his wife.

At least nine individuals have been arrested in Northern Virginia for attempting to support ISIS since the group rose to power in 2014, according to a report from law enforcement officials.

According to the report, which was obtained by The Washington Times, the nine individuals were arrested for providing or attempting to provide support to ISIS and included a police officer and several U.S. Army soldiers.

The Washington Times reports:

Law enforcement agencies have arrested nine Northern Virginia residents on charges of aiding the Islamic State since the terrorist group rose to power in Syria and Iraq in 2014 and launched social media propaganda to attract followers, a government message to police states.

…

Of the nine Northern Virginians who were arrested, all but one were in their teens and early 20s. They included a police officer, a Starbucks barista, Army soldiers, bankers and a cabdriver. Four of the nine graduated from Northern Virginia high schools, one with honors. Two attended Northern Virginia Community College.

According to the Times, one of the men, a U.S. army combat engineer named Mohammad Bilor Jalloh, attempted to purchase firearms in an attempt to carry out a “Fort Hood style” attack.

Another man, Metro police officer Nicholas Young, “traveled to Libya and gave advice to Islamic State followers on how to avoid law enforcement monitoring” according to law enforcement officials.

Several others planned on creating online propaganda for the terror group, with one seeking to encourage “lone wolf” style attacks on Washington DC.

The report raises new concerns about the reach of the terror group into the U.S. homeland, and any future plans to import new refugees from troubled Muslim nations.

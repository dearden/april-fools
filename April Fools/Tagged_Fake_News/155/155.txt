These celebrities had some, uh, extreme responses to the possibility of Donald Trump winning the White House.

Rev. Al Sharpton has said he’s “reserving my ticket to get out of here if he wins.”

The View’s Whoopi Goldberg said, “I don’t think that’s America. I don’t want it to be America.”

“Maybe it’s time for me to move,” she added.

Sienna Miller and Bryan Cranston also made it clear that they intend to leave the U.S. due to a Trump presidency.

And Raven-Symone imparted this gem.


Hannity.com published a list of celebrities who have made similar declarations.

Funnily enough, someone on a Nova Scotia island may have the answer to their problems.

An online campaign called “Cape Breton If Donald Trump Wins” is offering Trump haters a new home.

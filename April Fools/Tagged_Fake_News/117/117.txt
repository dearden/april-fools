Donald Trump has requested to have a meeting with Charles Koch of the Koch Brothers to discuss his campaign going forward. Now I know some of you may be thinking “But we don’t want Donald in bed with the Kochs!”

Well, hold on a second. This may be genius. You see, in reality, the Kochs WILL end up funding one of the 2 main party candidates, either Trump or Clinton. If Trump can ensure they do NOT support the Clinton campaign, he can effectively deprive her of billions while securing some for himself.



But that’s not all. Unlike normal politicians, Donald Trump is not coming into the meeting absolutely NEEDING their cash. In fact, he has more than enough of his own to whoop Hillary Clinton back to 1967! This gives him what professional negotiators call a “Power Position.”

See, his popular support amongst the people and his own money mean that the Kochs NEED HIM if they want to maintain their corrupt empire and vast fortune. Since it’s not mutual, how could they say no?

So I am proud to see Donald Trump leveraging his position to build a war chest so MASSIVE that all the Clinton media ties in the world will not be able to stop the infinite momentum of the Trump Train.

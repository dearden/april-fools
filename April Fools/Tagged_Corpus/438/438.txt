Managing director of AlphaBiolabs, David Thomas, said:  <quote> "We were convinced that consumers wanted the option of being able to see the product and walk away with it in their basket.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "These fantastic sales figures proved we were right, and we're proud that we are the first laboratory in the UK to offer an off the shelf paternity test, supported by our first class 24-hour turnaround service." </quote> 

He added:  <quote> "As there are only a couple of UK-based DNA testing laboratories our main competition is from cheap tests coming in from outside of the UK.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "These are not accredited to the high standard which the UK public want, so we want AlphaBiolabs to always strive to bring the fastest, most accurate DNA testing service available and fly the flag for UK." </quote> 

Home Bargains said they would be getting more in, but were unable to say when.

The company declined to comment further on the story when contacted by the Post.

How does the kit work?

Customers swab the cheeks of all the individuals involved, then post the samples back to the laboratory.

Results are sent by email.

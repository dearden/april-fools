Bulbagarden webmaster Archaic has been declared missing by Canadian authorities after a computer error at the Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection resulted in him being deported to Ontario. Search teams are currently combing the area around the Toronto Pearson International Airport after he was misplaced by Canadian customs officers.

 <quote> "We offer our deepest apologies to Mr. Pomfret's family. We are working hard with our partners in Australia to track him down and make sure that he is safely reunited with his family, and we will not rest until he has back home." </quote>  a Canadian Border Services Agent was quoted as saying during a press conference. Australian officials working on the case believe the error arose after immigration computer systems flagged him because of a  <quote> "failure to meet minimum criminal ancestry requirements," </quote>  which led to him mistakenly being labeled an illegal alien.

Sources working with the search have indicated some concern that Archaic arrived in the country dressed in clothes that are not suitable for the cold Canadian weather, but they also said that they have received several credible tips that Archaic has been spotted in a few clothing boutiques in the area.

Bulbagarden vice-webmaster Evil Figment, a Canadian native, is collaborating with other Bulbagarden staff and search officials in tracking down Archaic.  <quote> "We're leaving no stone unturned. Evan is bringing in our private helicopter to help with the search, and we've activated his tracking collar." </quote>  Staff have also stated that Bulbagarden's operations would not be affected by Archaic's current absence.

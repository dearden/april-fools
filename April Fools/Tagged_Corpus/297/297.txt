Tin Pei Ling has announced on her new Facebook page that she'll be doing what no one else thought is possible. She says she wants to prove to everyone in Singapore that she is no bimbo by standing on top of a moving MRT train while holding a PAP flag on her right hand and her favourite Kate Spade bag on her left hand! She also adds that for this very dangerous stunt, she will be training with a guy who has done this before.

The guy known as the MRT Train Surfer first made the news in Singapore back in April last year. Watch the video of the guy standing on top of a moving MRT train here.



Looks very dangerous right? Good luck Tin Pei Ling. Try not to fall. That Kate Spade bag is expensive.

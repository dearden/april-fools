Korean cuisine is experiencing the kind of revival that its musical counterpart, K-pop, has been undergoing for years, and so it’s only appropriate that JYP Entertainment is at the helm of this most recent culinary wave.

The record label, which has churned out all-star acts in Asia, including American crossover group the Wonder Girls (the five-member Korean girl group toured with the Jonas Brothers in 2009), opened the doors of its first restaurant venture earlier this month, generating buzz in the musical and culinary realms alike.

Kristalbelli, a self-proclaimed  <quote> “high-end Korean barbecue restaurant,” </quote>  is tucked into the heart of Manhattan just a few blocks north of the city’s designated  <quote> “Koreatown” </quote>  and is part lounge, part restaurant - and all taste.

 <quote> “We wanted to introduce Korean food in a very hip and edgy way where the trendsetters of New York can come and enjoy good food and have a good time,” </quote>  founder and Korean music mogul J.Y. Park told the Daily News of the eatery.

 <quote> “We also wanted to make this a networking place, where people who really care about culture can come together.” </quote> 

Split between two levels - a restaurant featuring crystal barbecue grills on each table downstairs and a pulsing bar and lounge upstairs - Kristalbelli boasts the culinary prowess of David Shim, who has worked the kitchens of such NYC staples as L’Atelier de Joel Robuchon and Gramercy Tavern.

The crystal grills use infrared heat to cook the meat before customers at a higher temperature than either traditional gas or coal grills, and mark the first time the technology has been used in the United States, Park explained.

The current menu runs the gamut of wagyu beef, marinated rib eye and mushroom stew, and Park’s personal favorite, chadolbap, or thinly sliced beef brisket served with rice.

Park’s goal, to  <quote> “do for Korean food what Mr. Chow did for Chinese food,” </quote>  is already well on its way; the restaurant counts Horace Madison, Lil Wayne’s business manager, among its investors, and industry heavyweights like Fat Joe and  <quote> “Saturday Night Live” </quote>  actor Horatio Sanz among its customers.

And the young entrepreneur is optimistic that New Yorkers will soon be riding the Korean food wave too.

 <quote> “I think the new generation of Americans are really opening up their hearts and minds toward Asian cultures - food, fashion, music, movies,” </quote>  Park said.  <quote> “I think basically through the Internet, people are getting more open-minded.” </quote>

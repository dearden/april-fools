Yesterday afternoon, children at a mall in Ohio where shocked to find that instead of the Easter Bunny - they found a man dressed as the pickle from the now infamous Pickle Surprise video (directed by Tom Rubnitz) was waiting for them. For a ten minute period, the individual, who has since been identified as Durandal, did nothing but yell  <quote> "Pickle Surprise" </quote>  and  <quote> "HAI2U" </quote>  at the children. He was also offering  <quote> "free candy" </quote>  before he fled the facility once mall security arrived. When asked about the incident, mall-goer Chad Newsom stated that,  <quote> "I had no clue what was going on and thought it had something to do with Adult Swim." </quote>  Currently, no charges are planned on being filed as despite the disturbing event that took place, no children were abducted thanks to mall security. A photo was captured of Durandal in his getup, which can be seen below:



If you happen to see him in your area, please contact the local authorities.

Russian President Dmitry Medvedev concluded his March 31 op-ed,  <quote> "Building Russian-U.S. Bonds," </quote>  by affirming  <quote> "the truth" </quote>  of Alexis de Tocqueville's words predicting  <quote> "a great future for our two nations." </quote>  Tocqueville's actual words are sobering. At the conclusion of the first volume of  <quote> "Democracy in America," </quote>  Tocqueville predicted (in 1835) that Russia and America each seemed destined to  <quote> "hold the destinies of half the world in its hands one day." </quote>  His conclusion emphasizes the dramatic differences between the nations, then and now:

 <quote> "[T]hus the conquests of the American are made with the plowshare of the laborer, those of the Russian with the sword of the soldier.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "To attain his goal, the first relies on personal interest and allows the force and reason of individuals to act without directing them. The second in a way concentrates all the power of society in one man.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "The one has freedom for his principal means of action; the other servitude." </quote> 

Given President Obama's radical concentration of power in the executive branch, it would be fitting for him to affirm the truth of the source of American greatness.

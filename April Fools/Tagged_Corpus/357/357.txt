Goma (CNN) -- Authorities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have arrested Joseph Rao Kony, head of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) guerilla group-- officials said Friday.

Kony, who is responsible for ordering an estimated 66,000 children to become child soldiers, surrendered in a forest near Garamba National Park in the northeast section of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, according to officials. He was unarmed and unaccompanied.

Details of the surrender are unclear, but UN spokesperson Clifford Daniels reports that Kony's request was to speak to Jason Russell, director of the Invisible Children Inc. documentary KONY 2012, a call for American citizens to demand Kony's capture and arrest.

My army can protect me from United Nations forces and the United States government, but from the postings of American celebrities there is no escape. Too late I realized that an army of child soldiers in Congo are no match for an army of youth soldiers in America, armed not with guns but with computers." </quote>

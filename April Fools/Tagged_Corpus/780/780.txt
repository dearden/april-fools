Pope John Paul II died of blood poisoning and the collapse of his blood vessels, the Vatican announced on Sunday, releasing the official death certificate a day after the pontiff's passing.

The certificate listed the ailments the 84-year-old Pope suffered from, including acknowledging officially for the first time that John Paul had Parkinson's disease.

John Paul, who died on Saturday evening, had suffered heart and kidney failure brought on by a urinary tract infection last week. The official certificate used the medical terminology for blood poisoning and blood vessel collapse, which is septic shock and cardiocirculatory collapse.

The other ailments listed were episodes of acute breathing failure, resulting in a throat operation to insert a breathing tube in his windpipe; high blood pressure; lack of blood flow to the tissues and an enlarged prostate gland. The certificate said the urinary tract infection, and resulting deadly spread of that infection to the blood, was a complication of the prostate problem.

Enlargement of the prostate is common among elderly men. The enlargement constricts the urinary tract, leading to a reduction in the flow or urine, which makes it increasingly difficult to empty the bladder. If the bladder cannot empty properly, bacteria tend to linger and multiply, increasing the risk of a urinary tract infection.

The confirmation of the death was made through a heart monitoring machine, and he was declared dead after more than 20 minutes of monitoring his heart, the document said.

Bookshops are facing quotas on the number of foreign authors they can stock as the government plans to launch a  <quote> "British Books for British Readers" </quote>  campaign.

The Bookseller has learned Prime Minister David Cameron is set to give a speech today [1st April] outlining his latest iteration of the  <quote> "Big Society" </quote> . A DCMS spokesman said:  <quote> "The publishing industry needs protecting from the Browns, Larssons and Meyers of this world. We think British literature should be celebrated, not swamped. Crime novels set in gloomy Scandinavian forests have an unfair advantage over our cosy domestic settings, so we have to level the playing field to protect this vital domestic industry." </quote> 

Under the plans, bookshops will only be able to hold 10% of stock from overseas authors. Using rules originally framed for international football, authors with British grandparents could qualify as British. The government is also examining the special case of Irish writers. While Northern Irish writers could controversially be classed as British, Irish authors such as James Joyce and Cecelia Ahern would fall foul of the proposed rules.

Authors such as Kipling and Orwell, both born in India to British parents, or J G Ballard, born in China, would remain eligible. The status of British authors who move overseas or adopt  <quote> "foreign" </quote>  writing styles, like Lee Child, remains a grey area.

Foreign publishers reacted quickly to the news.  <quote> "We donâ€™t have to take any more Alexander McCall Smith or Jeffrey Archer you know," </quote>  said Danish editor Uwe Binhad of Loof Lirpa Associates.

Following the success of their previous electronic music compilations Tron: Legacy Reconfigured and Star Wars Headspace, Walt Disney Records announced plans to release an album of Tomorrowland remixes curated by Grammy Award-winning producer Rick Rubin.

The album, titled Not That Tomorrowland, will feature EDM tracks from today's top dance music artists inspired by composer Michael Giacchino's score, paired with sound effects and dialogue drawn from director Brad Bird's film.

On the star-studded tracklist, Baauer contributes  <quote> "Nix's Mix," </quote>  featuring Hugh Laurie's iconic speach from the film, while Kaskade and Flying Lotus tackle songs inspired by comic shop proprietors Hugo and Ursula Gernsback, respectively.

Shocked and horrified by the geometrically expanding demand for wireless broadband services, the Federal Commfiscation Commission exercised its powers of eminent domain today and confiscated the remaining broadcast television channels not already sold at auction. Most surprising of all was the declaration that this rare and important spectrum is going to be dedicated exclusively to the text messaging service, Twitter.

Twitter gets a powerboostFCC Chairman Lowon B. Andwidth explained that the Commission just completed an intensive study of Internet usage and found that the Twitter service is growing at such an astonishing rate that it will soon devour all available bandwidth.  <quote> “While it is bad enough that Twitter will bring web browsing, video streaming, text messaging and email to a halt,” </quote>  said Mr. Andwidth,  <quote> “a far worse situation will occur when Twitter users have to take a number and get in line to post their tweets. I don’t want to be in Washington when that mob of anti-social networkers descends on Capitol Hill.” </quote> 

In shortest supply is wireless bandwidth. Apparently, the lion’s share of cellular phone activity involves posting messages to Twitter rather than the growth previously expected from mobile video and web browsing. One young smartphone user was heard to exclaim,  <quote> “Does anyone actually surf the Web anymore? Who has the patience to read blogs and web pages? Anything worth saying can be said in 140 characters or less.” </quote> 

Twitter itself issued a 130 character statement expressing delight at the government’s pre-emptive action to prevent a massive Fail Whale epidemic from sweeping the nation, and requesting re-tweets. They vowed to expand server capacity to match the new wireless bandwidth capacity as best they can. TV stations that follow Twitter have already been tweeted to cease broadcasting immediately and return their licenses. The remaining stations will be getting old school telegrams.  <quote> “It’s unlikely anyone will be inconvenienced by this change,” </quote>  explained Chairman Andwidth.  <quote> “Everybody is on cable and satellite by now, anyway.” </quote> 

Expectations are that a swift coordinated move by the public and private sectors can ensure adequate messaging capacity at least until after the fall elections. After that, the FCC will likely look at shutting down other less important uses of the electromagnetic spectrum including most AM and FM music stations.  <quote> “We may even have to shut down microwave ovens and garage door openers if we can’t keep up with texting bandwidth demand,” </quote>  exclaimed an obviously frustrated chairman.

Also making quick moves to protect its interests, Google announced that it is going to take over non-wireless Internet service by offering 1 Gbps fiber optic connections to every city that performed ridiculous stunts to try to win Google broadband service for its residents.  <quote> “All other cities that didn’t make fools of themselves will be getting 10 Gbps Google Internet access free of charge,” </quote>  according to an unofficial Google statement. It went on to say:  <quote> “There is only one acceptable day for any foolishness and that is April 1.” </quote>

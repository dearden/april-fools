The Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum just announced that it has launched a Tribble Breeding Program as part of its celebration of Star Trek's 50th anniversary. Details about the program are addressed in a new, three-minute video below.

The video features Beth Wilson, one of the hosts of STEM in 30, an interactive classroom program consisting of 30-minute live webcasts that engage middle school students in STEM topics; Dr. Margaret Weitekamp, the museum's curator for space memorabilia and science fiction; General J.R.  <quote> "Jack" </quote>  Dailey, director of the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum; and other staffers, as they all interact with Star Trek's beloved and quickly reproducing creatures.

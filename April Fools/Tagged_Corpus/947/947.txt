Mr. Ivanishvili invited Tbilisi’s diplomatic corps to his headquarters on Thursday to condemn the citizenship decision.

 <quote> “I don’t think this has much effect on me, but it has a great effect on Saakashvili,” </quote>  Mr. Ivanishvili said in an interview.  <quote> “He will lose face. The euphoria which still exists in America and Europe, where he is trying to fool them into thinking he is a democrat, that euphoria will disappear.” </quote>

Mr. Ivanishvili, 56, has long been the subject of rumor in this city. After making his fortune in the Russian metal and banking industries, he returned to his home village of Chorvila and began providing his neighbors with houses, roads and cash, like a feudal lord. His legend was enhanced by tales about his two albino sons — the eldest, Bera, is a famous rapper — and a menagerie said to include zebras and penguins.

For years, he spread his Russian-earned wealth around lavishly — and anonymously. Mr. Ivanishvili was the mysterious buyer who paid $95.2 million for Picasso’s  <quote> “Dora Maar With Cat” </quote>  at Sotheby’s in 2006, sending art dealers into a tizzy. In Georgia, he anonymously financed church projects like the gold-domed cathedral that towers over the capital, and government ones like renovations of 500 schools, money to elevate state salaries and boots for the army. ( <quote> “They were running around in slippers,” </quote>  he said.)

Mr. Ivanishvili said his ties to Mr. Saakashvili were finally severed during a phone call in January 2008, when he told the president never to call him again. He said he took great pains to conceal his political plans, speaking in whispers with his wife even at home out of fear that he was under surveillance. Twice, he said, he arranged flights out of the country and then canceled them.

 <quote> “The decision was this: I needed to completely destroy my world view relating to philanthropy, as well as my relationship with him, and the fact that for 55 years I have been asserting that I would not go into politics,” </quote>  he said.  <quote> “I tormented myself a great deal.” </quote> 

Georgia’s government acted immediately after Mr. Ivanishvili’s bombshell.

Just four days later, the billionaire was stripped of his Georgian citizenship, on the basis that he had never informed officials that he was a citizen of France. (Georgian law permits dual citizenship only with special permission. Mr. Ivanishvili also had Russian citizenship, though he renounced it in December.) Two weeks later, the central bank seized millions of dollars as part of a money-laundering investigation of his bank. The governing party then introduced limits on corporate campaign financing, which would prevent his companies from bankrolling candidates.

Giga Bokeria, Mr. Saakashvili’s national security adviser, said he was not worried that Mr. Ivanishvili would buy the votes of Georgian citizens, but that unlimited use of his wealth — it amounts to more than a third of the country’s gross domestic product, by some measures —  <quote> “will corrupt the political process as such.” </quote>  He said Georgia’s opposition was just beginning to embrace healthy practices like conceding after an electoral defeat.

 <quote> “A new political culture was appearing, and that includes the idea that parties should stand on their own feet, and now this huge guy financially appears on the landscape,” </quote>  Mr. Bokeria said.  <quote> “Now all these groups, they are not looking to build their own support, it’s just a big oligarch guy — he calls the shots and he orders the melody.” </quote> 

The government has also charged that Mr. Ivanishvili is acting in the interest of Russia, offering as evidence his extensive holdings there: $1.1 billion, by his own account, which he says he is trying to liquidate. Mr. Saakashvili rarely mentions Mr. Ivanishvili by name, but he alludes to him frequently, warning of  <quote> “new political forces” </quote>  and  <quote> “forces of darkness” </quote>  and an infusion of Russian cash.

Among Mr. Ivanishvili’s responses has been to adopt a government strategy, hiring lobbyists in Washington to spread the word about the measures being taken against him. Elements of the case — like aggressive questioning of opposition activists by a state auditing agency — have drawn rebukes from American officials.

 <quote> “For years, on our money, Saakashvili had strong lobbyists, and played with our money, and tried to lie and show a facade of democracy,” </quote>  Mr. Ivanishvili said.  <quote> “I can also permit myself to hire some lobbying companies, in America among other places, and we can try to show the real picture.” </quote> 

Mr. Ivanishvili’s political platform is vague and, in some respects, grandiose. He proposes to leave the office of prime minister after two years, a period he says is sufficient to create an independent court system and purge what he calls  <quote> “elite corruption.” </quote>  Asked about whether the standoff would culminate in street demonstrations, he answered with serene confidence.

 <quote> “If I go out, I can gather 100,000 people in three minutes, but I don’t want to,” </quote>  he said.  <quote> “Until the elections. After the elections, if there is falsification, we will defend our votes.” </quote> 

Mr. Ivanishvili’s parliamentary coalition, Ivanishvili-Georgian Dream, hopes to win half the votes in October elections. A poll performed by the National Democratic Institute and leaked to the Georgian news media last month suggested that it would fall well short of that, giving Mr. Saakashvili’s party 47 percent of the vote and Mr. Ivanishvili’s coalition trailing with 10 percent. But the same poll showed that the public overwhelmingly supports Mr. Ivanishvili in his fight to regain his citizenship.

People approached on the street this week were iffy about Mr. Ivanishvili as a politician, but they raved about his philanthropic work, his support for museums and theaters, and the riches granted to his neighbors in Chorvila.

Nodar Melikidze, 48, who is unemployed, said Mr. Ivanishvili had paid for one of his friends’ cancer treatments.

Lela, 54, said Wednesday’s decision about the citizenship left a sour taste in her mouth.  <quote> “They showed they are very confident in themselves, and they don’t care about people’s opinions,” </quote>  said Lela, who would not give her last name for fear of repercussions.  <quote> “They have washed their hands of us. Many people were not going to vote for Ivanishvili, but by taking this decision the government showed it ignored people.” </quote>

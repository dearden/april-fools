Microsoft's monthly patching exercise took place one week earlier this month as the software giant is preparing for the simultaneous launch of Windows XP Service Pack 3 and its Internet Explorer 8 web browser.

Amongst the thirteen patches released is what observers describe as an unexpected upgrade that allows Genuine Windows user to change your default interface from Windows XP to Windows Vista, adding what observers call, a Pseudo Aero look.

 <quote> "The Aero interface is all about eye candiness and a free upgrade from Microsoft was what Windows XP (or 2003) users have been clamoring for" </quote> , said a senior source at Microsoft who wanted to remain anonymous.

ITProportal understands that Microsoft has secretly acquired the company behind Vista Transformation Pack and repackaged it for existing Windows XP users.

According to VTP's website,  <quote> "this program [see below] will transform your Windows user interface to ultimate Windows Vista alike looks that everyone will never notice itâ€™s the same old Windows XP (or 2003)" </quote> .

Microsoft has also released an updated version of the Microsoft Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool on Windows Update, Microsoft Update, Windows Server Update Services, and the Download Center.

The company has also urged users to install the set of patches to close a vulnerability that allows hackers to install a dangerous trojan horse that looks like a spider crab and which apparently converts compromised computers into email zombie computers.

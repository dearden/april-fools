In a move that seems odd, Square Enix announced that actor Nicolas Cage will be doing a series of voices for their newest installment of their Final Fantasy Series.  Set to release in North America in late September, Final Fantasy XV is set in modern day Earth where there are teams of monsters, bad guys and of course, spikey haired protagonists.  Noctis Lucis Caelum is the main character at hand who will have the pleasure of being voiced by the American actor.  When asked about the role Cage went on to say:

 <quote> “You know, I’m in a lot of films here in America.  I have done just about everything I can to be the best Nicolas Cage in the world.  And now with that, I had to take a step into a new realm, something Nicolas Cage is not used to.  I had to ask myself….HOW AM I NOT IN THAT VIDEO GAME?!  I mean come on! The guy has a name thats super close to mine! Noctis Lucis Caelum; turn it around you got Nicolas Cage!” </quote>

Also noted as voice actors for the game are Gilbert Godfrey, Clint Eastwood and Gary Busey, all noted to play female characters in the game.  We here at Mammoth interviewed Gary Busey outside of a local Burger King and he had this to say:

 <quote> “See the problem with the world is it’s too big.  Space and time and space are just space.  And if we can’t all just have our own final fantasy then we’re no better than the gophers.  I can’t wait for this.  It’s in my blood. And in my teeth, excuse me…“ </quote>

The Gulf sultanate of Oman donated $10m to the Japanese Red Cross to aid with relief efforts in the quake and tsunami-devastated country, the government of Japan said Monday.

A magnitude 9.0 earthquake and five-storey high tsunami left 27,000 dead or missing and 350,000 people homeless after it swept the country on March 11.

The aftermath sparked Japan’s biggest humanitarian crisis since World War II, causing an estimated $300m in damages and ranking it among the world’s costliest natural disasters.

Oman, which in March accepted a $10bn economic aid package from the Gulf states in a bid to quell protests in the sultanate, is thought to be the first GCC member to publicly donate to aid efforts in the South Asia country.

The Red Cross has dispatched more than 200 emergency relief teams to the disaster zone and organized thousands of volunteers to assist victims affected by the disaster.

 <quote> “I was attracted to the beauty of the area and the small-town atmosphere,” </quote>  she said,  <quote> “and bought property the first time we visited.” </quote>  She added that Cambria doesn’t have the traffic noise and the crowds common to so much of the California coast.

The Scene

Ms. Carson, who lived in Kalispell, Mont., before moving to Cambria full time, liked the place so much that she eventually became executive director of its Chamber of Commerce. She says Cambria is often promoted as a romantic getaway for couples who want to gaze at sunsets over the Pacific or walk hand in hand through trails of coastal wildflowers. Many of the inns and bed-and-breakfasts place champagne and roses in the rooms.

Main Street is aptly named, given that it’s the one road that snakes through both the East and West Villages. East Village is older, with some of its Victorian heritage still intact, while West Village is newer and seems to be filled with real estate agencies.

Throughout the unincorporated town there are more than 20 art galleries that specialize in works in glass and sculpture and coastal landscape paintings; there are scores of shops like Flying Fuzzies Needlework and Village Wizard —  <quote> “Merchant of Miracles” </quote> ; and restaurants.

Dinner can be barbecued beef ribs eaten on the patio of the Main Street Grill or cherried duck at the Black Cat, a cozy fireplace-lit bistro. There are wine tastings at places like Fermentations and Harmony Cellars, antiques shopping, live entertainment — including theater and a piano bar — at the Pewter Plough Playhouse and lawn bowling at the Joslyn Center.

Though there are ample diversions in town, many choose to spend their time outdoors. The kayaking, surfing, hiking and biking rarely cease, but walking along the cliffs and spotting cottontails and ground squirrels along the coastal scrub is popular even in rainy weather.

And Cambria is home to Moonstone Beach, which is made up of pebbles of amethyst, gypsum, rose quartz and milky moonstone. Wooden stairs take visitors down cliffs to the surf 100 feet below. On those slippery rocks, when you’re swaddled by the bellow of the sea, thoughts of civilization fall away.

Millie Sweeting has lived in Cambria for 23 years. She discovered the town when she and her husband were sailing up the California coast.  <quote> “We didn’t even know it existed,” </quote>  she said.

They moved from San Diego in 1985, buying a $225,000 home in the Lodge Hill section with an ocean view.  <quote> “I told everyone the only way I was leaving here was feet first,” </quote>  she said.  <quote> “We didn’t know anybody, and all our friends thought we were crazy.” </quote> 

Pros

There is no shortage of places to buy wine. Besides the shops in town, there are more than 100 wineries within 30 miles of Cambria, from small family-owned operations like Castoro Cellars to more commercial enterprises like Wild Horse Winery & Vineyards (both are about 25 miles east, in Templeton). The Central Coast vineyards are traditionally known for their pinot noirs, cabernet sauvignons and chardonnays.

The wine aside, second-home owners are also lured by a small town that has a striking coastline, pine forests and a definite lack of traffic.  <quote> “People come to live here more for what we don’t have than what we have,” </quote>  said James Brett, president of Coldwell Banker Don Bricker Real Estate.

And Cambria probably won’t lose that small-town feeling because water is scarce. In 2001, the Cambria Community Services District placed a moratorium on water permits until a new water source could be found.

Cons

Ms. Soucie said that although there are clubs and social events, Cambria could be challenging for younger people.  <quote> “When I was in my 40s,” </quote>  she said,  <quote> “I don’t think I would have wanted to move here.” </quote> 

She said younger people tend to spend more time in the city of San Luis Obispo, which has a median age of 26.2 and is the home of California Polytechnic State University. The Census Bureau puts Cambria’s median age at 50.9.

There is only one grocery store in Cambria, and the town doesn’t have much in the way of national chains. The nearest mall or specialty grocery stores are 30 minutes away in San Luis Obispo and jobs are scarce.

The Real Estate Market

Mr. Brett said his typical customer is someone who passes through on the way to the Hearst Castle in San Simeon to the north, walks through the village and  <quote> “falls in love.” </quote> 

Lance Morales, who owns Cambria Pines Realty, said that Cambria started off as a weekend and summer retreat before becoming a magnet for retirees in the 1980s.

Aside from extensive house remodeling near the ocean, there is little building going on. Most housing is 20 to 100 years old, and it includes small cabins, coastal bungalows and towering luxury beach houses.

Entry-level homes are usually found in Park Hill, Lodge Hill or Happy Hill, where a house with an ocean view is $500,000 to $600,000. Those closer to the ocean, like homes at Sea Cliff Estates, can cost more than $1 million.

 <quote> “When you compare it to Monterey or Montecito,” </quote>  Mr. Morales said,  <quote> “Cambria’s a bargain.” </quote> 

Seven homes sold in February, with a median price of $630,000, according to DataQuick Information Systems.

A recent survey of single-family homes ranged from a low of $365,000 for a one-bedroom, one-bathroom, 702-square-foot cabin with views of the Santa Lucia Mountains to $11.9 million for a 9,760-square-foot, six-bedroom, six-bathroom estate on 142 acres with an ocean view.

Mr. Morales said that most potential buyers want to be close to the ocean.  <quote> “And the coup de grâce,” </quote>  he said,  <quote> “is to be amid the pines with a panoramic ocean view.” </quote>

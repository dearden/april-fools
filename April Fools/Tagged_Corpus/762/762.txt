Earlier in the week, the Italian prime minister was reprimanded by the Queen when he spoke too loudly during an official G20 photograph.

Television footage of Mr Berlusconi's latest breach of summit etiquette shows him arriving to join the other 27 Nato leaders, including US President Barack Obama, for a group photograph on a bridge spanning the Rhine between Kehl and Strasbourg.

Climbing out of his limousine, the Italian leader took a mobile phone call instead of walking to greet Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor.

Left standing alone on the red carpet, Miss Merkel smiled weakly before turning away to greet other leaders, including Prime Minister Gordon Brown, as they arrived in their motorcades.

Seven or eight minutes later, all the other 27 Nato leaders had arrived - except Mr Berlusconi, who was still speaking on his phone.

At one moment, after the others had entered a marquee, Miss Merkel even peeked out to see if the Italian leader was coming in to join the photo before shrugging her shoulders.

He was not. His phone call continued, and when a German military brass band struck up, Mr Berlusconi put his finger in his ear and walked further down the river bank to escape the noise.

Without Mr Berlusconi in sight, Nato leaders then walked the  <quote> "passerelle" </quote>  to meet Nicolas Sarkozy, the French President, half way across the Rhine to pose for a photograph, a moment meant to symbolise the reconciliation of old foes on Nato's 60th birthday.

Mr Berlusconi also missed a minute's silence in honour of Nato soldiers killed in action.

Italian officials have claimed that Mr Berlusconi was on the phone talking to Turkish prime minister Tayyip Erdogan.

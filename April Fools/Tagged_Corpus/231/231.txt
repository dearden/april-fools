In the early hours of this morning hundreds of Gold meteorites landed in the small town of Carlingford in Ireland.

It was only in the light of day when examined by experts, that it was discovered the meteorites recovered so far are solid gold. Most meteorites are made from nickel and iron so to find gold meteorites is absolutely incredible.

Locals believe that this incident is to do with the fact that the annual Leprechaun Hunt, takes place this weekend with thousands of people now arriving in Carlingford, to hunt for Leprechauns. Now they will be able to hunt for gold at the same time as they are hunting for Leprechauns.

Mark this date in your calendar because your not going to get any more gold meteorites.

The house is worth about Â£500,000

They have lived in the local authority-owned, Grade II listed, four-storey house, in Kings Cross since 1973.

The inhabitants are set to be awarded the freehold of the property in Calthorpe Street on Monday, after taking the council to county court.

Camden Council is powerless to prevent the legal move because squatters have lived there more than 12 years.

The council did begin legal proceedings in 1983 to evict them and won a possession order but bailiffs failed to execute the warrant.

We feel amazingly lucky

Squatters' statement

Although the Land Registration Act was changed in 2002, the group was able to use earlier legislation which allowed squatters to claim possession if they had spent 12 years in a property.

Late last year the squatters, Agoshaman Ceribel, 71, Umiak Mahoupe, 50, and a friend known only as Anne, served the council with a county court claim demanding they be registered as the owners.

In a statement the squatters, who are all artists, described Camden Council's housing department as  <quote> "a shambles over the years." </quote> 

Obviously we regret the current situation but it has arisen as a result of failure to take action some considerable time ago

Audit of properties

A council spokeswoman said it will not be fighting the court claim, adding:  <quote> "Once the current occupants have got the freehold, the property is theirs to do with as they wish.

Frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, Donald Trump, is allegedly in advanced talks to add AC Milan to his international sporting empire, which already includes a number of golf courses.

The 69-year-old recently made a detour from the campaign trail to fly into Italy on an overnight flight from Chicago.

The former High School variety soccer star was spotted getting into a waiting car outside Casa Milan in the early hours of the morning.

Former Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, had been attempting to sell the club to Thai businessman Bee Taechaubol for some time before the American tycoon stepped in to unexpectedly come close to sealing a deal.

The Rossoneri were regarded as a valuable political tool for Berlusconi and the Trump campaign now hope that the ‘make Milan great again’ platform will help tap into the large Italian-American demographic.

The Republican frontrunner has also reportedly opened talks with Trump Tower inhabitant, Cristiano Ronaldo, in a bid to take him to the Stadio San Siro.

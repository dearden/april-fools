Michael Jackson killed himself - delivering the fatal injection that ended his life, his doctor reportedly plans to argue.

The Web site TMZ.com revealed Sunday that deathbed doctor Conrad Murray hopes to dodge manslaughter charges by claiming he was out of the room when the King of Pop pumped a lethal dose of sedatives into his body.

A spokeswoman for Ed Chernoff, Murray's top lawyer, did not deny the report, telling The News that she didn't know the identity of TMZ's unnamed sources.

The TMZ report, a day before Murray is to appear in court Monday, lays out a time line that has Murray in the bathroom when the fatal injection was administered.

Murray will claim he gave Jackson 25 milligrams of the sedative Propofol - far less than the dose that put the King of Pop into cardiac arrest - then hung out in Jackson's room, talking on the phone while the pop star dozed for an hour.

He returned from two minutes in the bathroom to find Jackson had awakened, and in frustration at his inability to sleep, the pop star had injected the rest of a bottle of Propofol into his body.

The account did not sit right with Jackson's father.  <quote> "He's beyond mad," </quote>  said Brian Oxman, a lawyer for the pop star's dad.  <quote> "He's heartbroken that people want to come up with these stories." </quote>

There is 900 trillion cubic feet of natural gas under Qatar and the LNG facility which has made it possible to provide some of this fuel to the UK will be officially opened tomorrow (Monday).

Prince Andrew and the Emir of Qatar will be among the guests at tomorrow’s ceremony which will celebrate the newly formed links between the small Arab Emirate in the Middle East and South West Wales.

The mayor of Milford Haven, Cllr John Roberts, and the leader of Pembrokeshire County Council, Cllr John Davies, will also be there to see the facility which will be dedicated to providing LNG to South Hook, known as Train Four.

Train Four - part of the Ras Laffan industrial city 50 miles North of Qatar’s capital, Doha – will take in gas from Qatar’s vast reserves, remove the impurities and cool it to -160 degrees C to produce LNG, which is then shipped to Milford Haven.

A full report on the inauguration will follow.

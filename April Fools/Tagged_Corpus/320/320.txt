Have you always wanted to play 3DS and DS games on your big screen TV at home? The wait will soon be over.

Today, Nintendo announces that there will be a new peripheral for your Wii system that can allow the playing of 3DS/DS games on your TV using your Wii console.

The device is simple, plug in your 3DS/DS Game Card into the 3DS Game Card Adapter, plug the adapter into the GameCube memory card slot, start your Wii, and you'll be playing 3DS/DS games on your TV. A system update will automatically be applied to your system to allow this functionality.

3DS/DS games will be controlled using the Wii remote and nunchuk set or using the Wii classic controller. As 3DS/DS games have a secondary touch screen, there is an option to display both screens on the TV at the same time when needed, and use the Wii remote pointer to make selections on the virtual touch screen.

Users who have a 3DTV may enable the 3D option for the playing 3DS games on the Wii for an enhanced experience.

The upcoming Wii U console does not support GameCube accessories, therefore this adapter cannot be used. It is not currently known what support will be available for playing 3DS and DS games on the Wii U. However, Nintendo strongly suggests more details may be revealed at this year's E3 show.

The 3DS Game Card Adapter will have a manufacturer's suggested retail price of $12.99 and is expected to be shipped to retailers later this spring.

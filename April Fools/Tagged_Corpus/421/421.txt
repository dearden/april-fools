After seeing that huge gas engine Losi stuffed into the new 8IGHT buggy, we never thought we’d ever see an 1/8 scale RC car with a larger engine. But now Pro-Line Racing takes things in an even crazier direction by cramming a mind numbingly massive .81 gas powerplant into the 1/10 scale Pro-2 short course truck! While they’re keeping the full details of this insane project under wraps, the guys at Pro-Line tell us it’s an absolute wheelie monster that can reach speeds of over 85 mph! With that Dynamite .81 pumping out a claimed 6.7 horsepower, we can’t say we’re surprised. Pro-Line is expected to officially release the new gas powered Pro-2 in the coming months with a Pro-MT version following soon after. In the mean time go check out the pictures of this crazy new RC truck below! BTW Did we mention that Traxxas is rumored to be creating a 4-stroke powered T-Maxx too?

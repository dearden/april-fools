Inspired by the Tiger Lily, scientists at the Interflora laboratory have created two animal-inspired blooms – the Tiger Rose and the Leopard Rose.

These distinctive flowers have been eight years in the making and are the perfect gift for animal lovers and fashionistas alike.

The development of the Tiger and Leopard Roses has been a painstaking job, with scientists cleverly mixing highly complex DNA samples to create the distinctive animal print patterns.

The team – headed by Professor Davies – are extremely excited about the new development.

Speaking on Monday, Prof Davies said:  <quote> “I have long been a fan of the big cat and spent many years in Africa studying habitat before returning to England to take up my post with Interflora.

Animal prints have long been sought after in fashion and leopard print is a firm favourite with stars such as Kate Moss and Rihanna.

The flowers will be available soon in a mixed bouquet, which will retail at £40. Longer-term plans include corsages, which are sure to prove popular for proms.

In the cold winter of 2006, a pear ripened that would forevermore change the fruity landscape of the Internet. Its submission to DeviantArt by ursulav brought with it so many questions: Lol wut? Why? It eats birds?

What is that chipmunk wearing?

How have we never noticed the giraffes?

Why do our internal DeviantArt site metrics report a steady rise in pear art over the last 10 years that finally hit capacity last month, taking over our algorithms and resulting in an artistic barrage of our most popular subject to date: lots and lots of vaguely ominous grinning pears?

The world may never know. But we must cater to the wishes of our deviants, so it's all pears all the time now. Break out your forks, kids. We're having pear salad tonight.

We know you have Biting Pear of Salamanca Fan Art on your desktop. Everyone does. Fanfiction perhaps? We accept it all! Submit yours today!

Show your solidarity with your new Biting Pear Overlord and change your avatar to one of these fine pears. Or make your own! Pear yourself!

All eligible submissions to our new Pear Category will get a Pear Badge that will display proudly on your profile for all to see. Note: Having the Pear Badge prevents the Biting Pear of Salamanca from biting YOU!

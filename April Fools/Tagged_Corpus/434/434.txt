The Coca-Cola Company is a longtime sponsor and drink supplier at the Disney World and Disneyland theme parks. It has been present since Disneyland’s opening day of July 17, 1955. Today we have received word that Disney will be cancelling that partnership and instead offering Pepsi products at all Disney theme parks starting July 4th, 2015, to coincide with the 50th Birthday of Pepsi!

Frito-Lay which is owned by Pepsi is available at all Disney theme parks and it makes logical sense to extend their previous contract agreement with Pepsi to include soft drinks as well.

We have only been given limited details on the changes coming to the parks over the next few months but I am sure there will be an official release posted today April 1st.

Here are some of the changes happening:

Club Cool at Walt Disney World will be changing from Coke flavors from around the world to Mountain Dew’s Refreshment Corner. Here you will have the opportunity to try all the flavors of Mountain Dew including:

Code Red
Live Wire
Voltage
Throwback
White Out
Johnson City Gold
Game Fuel Citrus Cherry
Game Fuel Lemonade
Baja Blast
and Solar Flare

Refreshment Corner at Disneyland will be changed to Club Cold sponsored by Pepsi. Here you can take a break on the shaded patio and listen to the tinkling ivories of Disney’s ragtime piano player. Enjoy crowd-pleasing American classics like hot dogs, sourdough chili bowls, soft pretzels, desserts and Pepsi fountain drinks.

Over the next few months Disney Addicts will see Coke signs coming down from all theme parks and replaced with Pepsi signage. As we get more details we will post them.

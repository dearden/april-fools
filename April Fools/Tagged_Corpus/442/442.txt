Naughty Dog announced today that Ucharted would be delayed once again this time indefinitely in order to bring the series to Xbox.

 <quote> “We feel that a series like this deserves to be told on all platforms.  Therefore, we will be once again delaying the release of Uncharted 4 until further notice and halt all gold press of the game.  In addition, the Uncharted Collection will be available on the Xbox One immediately starting today on the Xbox Store and on retail shelves.  We will announce a release date for Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in the near future.  We apologize for any frustration this may cause to ou fans, but we hope you all understand that we want Uncharted to be played with as broad of an audience as possible, so this had to be done.” </quote>  – Naughty Dog

No word on when Uncharted 4 will finally be released, but one must say that the delays of this game have put a lot of fans on edge.  Many plan on boycotting the release due to the eventual release on Xbox One and many aren’t happy that the title is no longer a PlayStation Exclusive.

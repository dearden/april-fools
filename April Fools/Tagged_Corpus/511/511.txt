Following the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the resulting privacy concerns, Facebook has finally decided to let users see who viewed their profile.

Facebook is in full crisis management mode. Users are fleeing the platform following the revelations that personal data was shared in bulk with third-parties. Many think that the Cambridge Analytica scandal was only the tip of the iceberg and are asking for stronger privacy controls on Facebook.

One of the features that always tops conversations among users is the ability to know who has visited their profiles. LinkedIn has always had it ‚Äì although you need to be a premium member to really access the full list of who has viewed your profile ‚Äì but Facebook was always against sharing this information with users.

It seems however that the recent events have weakened the company‚Äôs position.

Yes, you can now see who has viewed your Facebook profile. The new feature lets you see who visited your profile in the past 30 days, past day as well as who has viewed your most recent posts.

The feature is buried deep in your privacy settings and is only available on the iOS app for now. To access the list of who has viewed your profile, open the main drop-down menu (the 3 lines) and scroll all the way down to  <quote> ‚ÄúPrivacy Shortcuts.‚Äù </quote>  There, just below the new  <quote> ‚ÄúPrivacy Checkup‚Äù </quote>  feature, you will find the new  <quote> ‚ÄúWho viewed my profile?‚Äù </quote>  option.

It is not clear if this is a test and/or if this will be rolled out to all users in the coming days. We have reached out to Facebook for clarifications and will update this post as soon as we hear back from them.

Let us know in the comments if you have access to the new feature. Some reports show that the feature may only be available on April 1st.üòÇ

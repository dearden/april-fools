Most people would at least finish high school before releasing an autobiography. But Miley Cyrus is not most people.

She is practically two people — the real-life incarnation of Disney's billion-dollar  <quote> "Hannah Montana" </quote>  franchise, and Miss Miley Cyrus, a precocious Southern girl who just released 272 pages on the life lessons she has learned in all of her 16 years.

Here's the rest: Critics' Choice and Golden Globe nominations, an impressive Grammy performance alongside pal Taylor Swift, a Kids' Choice Award, the cover of Glamour magazine, the premiere of  <quote> "Hannah Montana: The Movie" </quote>  this coming Friday.

And that's just been the first few months of 2009. Even at this young age she's more than just a starlet — Miley is a full-blown pop phenomenon. The line between Hannah the character and Miley the superstar is blurry at best.

The character takes on aspects of the real girl — both are Tennessee natives dealing with a new life in Hollywood, and dad Billy Ray Cyrus even plays her dad on the show. It's a level of fictional reality that makes perfect sense to teen viewers in this post-  <quote> "The Hills" </quote>  world.

 <quote> "It's all very confusing," </quote> Cyrus admits. <quote> "It's not so separate. I think it's really proven that as much as Hannah changes and as much as Miley changes, then again it's all the same person." </quote> 

She may be Disney's latest girl next door, but she has already weathered a few personal and professional storms that have portrayed her as not that innocent.

First there was the uproar over the Vanity Fair portrait that had her in little more than a sheet. Then came the personal photos leaked online of her posing suggestively in her bathroom.

Paparazzi follow her and her boyfriend everywhere. Miley's living out her teenage years while everyone's watching.

 <quote> "She's just such a superstar that people are interested in everything she does, whether they love her or hate her. She's that one girl that everyone has an opinion on one way or another," </quote>  says Matt Rettenmund, editor in chief of Popstar! magazine.  <quote> "She's as big or bigger than Britney Spears." </quote> 

 <quote> "People will always say that I'm over-exposed and that's what I want, all this attention," </quote>  says Miley.  <quote> "That's not it. What I love is the art of it all." </quote> 

 <quote> "Music is not something that was thrust upon her as another way to make money or make her name bigger. It's something that she genuinely wanted to pursue," </quote> says Rettenmund.

And for all the control Disney could exert, she's a 16-year-old who does voice her opinion.

 <quote> "Even by the time her second album was released, she was pushing to have a say. She is going to break free from anything that is too youthful, probably even before she stops being a youth herself." </quote> 

On the soundtrack's country-tinged single  <quote> "The Climb," </quote>  Miley proves her musical chops playing guitar on a power ballad worthy of Faith Hill or Kelly Clarkson. She has one more season of the series, then plans to make it big on the big screen.

She'll be shooting  <quote> "The Last Song" </quote>  this summer, in a part written for her. With Nicholas Sparks ( <quote> “The Notebook” </quote> ) penning it, she's bound to have a bona fide non-Hannah hit under her belt by next year.

And she's poised to succeed at exactly the moment other Disney stars seem to have stalled — Hilary Duff has made an unremarkable string of teen-oriented comedies and technopop albums since wrapping the show ‘Lizzie McGuire' in 2004; Lindsay Lohan is focusing on her leggings line and developing tanning lotions after both her acting and music careers imploded following several trips to rehab.

 <quote> "One of the things Miley's got going for her is that she already has so much more recognition," </quote> says Rettenmund.

 <quote> "Hilary really didn't break out beyond being a teen idol until quite a long time after her show was already done, whereas Miley is already straddling both worlds very easily right now." </quote>

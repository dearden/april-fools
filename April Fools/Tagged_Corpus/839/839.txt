Dell plans to acquire Make Technologies, which specializes in helping businesses replace outdated IT systems, the company said Thursday, marking its third enterprise-related acquisition announcement this week.Make Technologies aims to reduce costs for companies that use business-critical legacy systems, which are old applications or computer systems that continue to be used, even if there are newer products that do a better job and are often cheaper to run. Make Technologies migrates those legacy systems to a cloud infrastructure or other open standardized platforms.Dell is going to acquire the company to add a faster, more reliable and cost-effective approach to the re-engineering of applications, the company said. Make Technologies provides automated application and code migration tools that help migrate legacy applications to a more modern architecture.

The approximately 100 Make Technologies employees will be added to the Dell Service team, and the deal is expected to close in the second quarter of the company's fiscal year.On Monday, Dell announced it has agreed to buy Wyse Technology, a maker of software and hardware for thin clients. And on Tuesday, Dell announced it had purchased application modernization vendor Clerity Solutions.Dell plans to combine Make Technologies and Clerity into its existing Dell Services, which include application services, IT consulting and business process services, Dell said Thursday.

The stock market is in turmoil. The credit crunch bites harder every day. And the Treasury is still reeling in the wake of the Northern Rock crisis.

So who could blame Alistair Darling if he fancied his chances on the lottery every now and then?

This incredible insight into the nation's economy was captured during the Chancellor's weekly visit to his local newsagent, where he has become a regular Lotto customer.

Scrape expectations: Mr Darling tries a scratchcard

His official car stops briefly outside the West London shop while the canny Scot nips inside for a flutter.

Perhaps it was a sign of how difficult he is finding it to get to grips with the economy that yesterday he also tried his luck on a couple of scratchcards.

Other customers watched in amazement as the 54-year-old Cabinet Minister immediately scratched out the numbers with a £1 coin - and cursed his bad luck when he failed to win a prize.

Building worker Hugh Grenoble, 30, said:  <quote> "I actually did a double take when I saw him. I've never seen him in the flesh before but there ain't too many people in chauffeur driven cars around here - and he's the only bloke I know with mix and match eyebrows.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "I was trying to see what numbers he put on his card. Then I'd do anything but those numbers. They've got to be losers, haven't they?" </quote> 

Shop owner Jean Still told the Daily Mail:  <quote> "He's been coming here for quite a while, long before he became Chancellor.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "But he only started to do the lottery last year. I don't think he really knew how it worked. The first time he filled out the card he marked seven numbers on it instead of six. We had a good laugh about it - he said he was never very good at sums." </quote> 

Has the Chancellor ever had a windfall?  <quote> "He won £10 on the Lotto once," </quote>  said Mrs Still.

Downing Street declined to comment on Mr Darling's dabbling and refused to speculate on whether he might donate any sizeable wins to good causes. Such as the national debt, for example.

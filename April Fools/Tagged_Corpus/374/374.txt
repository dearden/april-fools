Switzerland -

The 60th Eurovision Song Contest in 2015 is ahead of us and to make it a true pan-European celebration, the EBU has revealed it'll be hosted in three different countries instead of just one!

In 2015 when Europe will hold the 60th Eurovision Song Contest, there will not be only one but three host countries! The winner of the 59th contest will host the Grand Final and the 2nd and third place the Semi-Finals.

 <quote> "This spreads the costs of hosting, it benefits three different cities and truly brings Europe together," </quote>  Jon Ola Sand, the EBU Executive Supervisor explains.

The idea has already generated a lot of buzz among the airlines in Europe who have shown huge interest in sponsoring the event in 2015 by giving away free tickets to all host cities.

What do you think of the change? Who would you like to be the three hosts in 2015?

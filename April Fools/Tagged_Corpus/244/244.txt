Sarah Palin announced Thursday morning in Rome that she had converted to Roman Catholicism.  Flanked by the Pope and other Vatican officials, Palin spoke for three minutes and took no questions.   In her statement, Palin discussed the importance of tradition and ritual and the solemnity of the majestic robes worn by the clergy.  Vatican watchers were quick to speculate that this move might help to distract from the growing unrest about the Pope's possible  mishandling of pedophile priests.  Will Sarah Palin bring to the Catholic Church what she brought to the Republican Party?


Palin followers were taken by surprise and some questioned how Palin had found the time to study Catholic doctrine and why she would make such a move just as her celebrity career was taking off.   Usually unreliable sources reported that she will spend the
next three months at an unnamed convent.   A spokesman for the Wasilla Assembly of God did not respond to emails or voice messages.   A malleable source in the White House would only say that the President wished the best for Palin and no decisions had been reached on how to repay the Pope.

Meanwhile,  a Palin Vanity Fair cover has appeared on the internet.

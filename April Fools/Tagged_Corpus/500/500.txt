Later this year, Japan will attempt to induce its own baby boom.

Japan’s rapidly aging population and declining birthrate has been a problem for decades now. There have been several attempts by the government to try and alleviate the issue, but so far none have met with much success.

However, one upcoming strategy may finally prove successful. It comes from the Japanese government’s Accelerated Family Bureau (AFB), which recently announced that starting later this year they will begin issuing  <quote> “breeding visas” </quote>  to residents of foreign countries.

▼ The visas will allow certain eligible foreign travelers

to enter Japan, just like any other current visa.

According to plans put forth by the AFB, breeding visas will be offered similarly to tourist, work, and family visas. However, breeding visas will have their processing expedited (typically available after one business day) and applicants will receive reimbursement on all travel expenses incurred.

Holders of breeding visas will be required to provide evidence of at least one pregnancy that they helped induce, either in themselves for females or in a Japanese citizen for males. Those unable to do so will have to pay a fine of no less than 50,000 yen (US$476) upon departure.

The AFB plans to issue breeding visas with stay durations of one week, one month, and a special one-day  <quote> “one night stand” </quote>  version that comes with extra bonuses unknown at this time.

▼ Rumors online have suggested that it will include free cosplay

costumes and love hotel vouchers, but they have not yet been confirmed.

In order to apply for a breeding visa, foreign residents will have to go to a Japanese consulate or embassy and fill out paperwork to ensure that they meet the eligibility requirements.

While details are still being worked out, applicants are required to be at least 21 years old, be in good physical and mental health, and have scored at least chunin level on the official Naruto Certification Exam.

Some have critiqued breeding visas, saying they should only be made available to foreign males, since the visa does not require female recipients to give birth to their  <quote> “breeding visa child” </quote>  in Japan and raise them there.

However, such criticisms were quickly silenced once the detractors realized what they were saying.

just with the intent of… oh. Yeah, never mind!” </quote> 

So what do you think? Will you be picking up a breeding visa of your own? Do you think it will be more successful than the government’s controversial policy last year to allow adopting of deer in Nara?

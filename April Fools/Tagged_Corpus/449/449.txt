City officials signed off today on a massive construction project, which promises to become a major international attraction on the north shore of the Tempe Town Lake.

Developer Spurious & Blunder Equities LLC – the U.S. subsidiary of Scotland-based Ignis Fatuus Industries Intl. – plans to break ground late this summer on Nessyland U.S.A., a 1.6MSF aquarium and amusement park, office complex and multifamily mixed-use development, according Spurious & Blunder Vice President of Development Karl Hungus.

 <quote> “This will be the absolutely hugest and most-classiest aquarium/amusement park/multifamily/office project ever seen in Tempe,” </quote>  said Hungus.  <quote> “I swear, everyone is gonna totally freak out when they see how classy and huge this thing is gonna be, for sure.” </quote> 

The project is the brainchild of award-almost-winning architect Kung Pao of design firm Tsao, Foo-Yung & BeefWithBroccoli, who first conceived of Nessyland after he suffered a traumatic brain injury while vacationing in Scotland. Dazed with excitement over the new amusement park concept, Kung immediately struck up a serious business arrangement with a group of local fisherman, who assured him they will be able to deliver the park’s star attraction in time a March 2017 grand opening.

 <quote> “The central attraction of the aquarium will be, of course, the Loch Ness monster,” </quote>  said Kung.  <quote> “With the opening of Nessyland, Tempe will join the ranks of the world’s most sought-after attractions, such as Kona Hawaii’s famous scenic urinal or the ruins of Chernobyl.” </quote> 

 <quote> “Also, it’s extremely important to consider … uuhhh … apples!” </quote>  Kung added before passing out unexpectedly.

The facility will be built in three phases and will include a family-friendly aquarium, which will feature the Scottish monster, along with various aquatic species indigenous to the Town Lake. In addition, the project will feature an 11-story office component with ground floor retail and underground parking, a 543-key luxury hotel, a 372-unit high-end condominium community, and a coffee machine.

Though no public records, officials or stakeholders were willing to offer any more details or confirmation, I heard from Madge down at the salon, while we sat beneath the automatic hair dryers, that Spurious & Blunder were also planning to purchase coffee filters for the coffee machine component of the project. Even though this were unconfirmed and likely just a rumor, I chose to report this fact anyway, because, you know … apples!

City stipulations require the developer to break ground no later than June 2019. The developer stated that no financing has yet to be arranged for the $850M project, but suggested he knew a bunch of guys who would for sure want to get in on this action.

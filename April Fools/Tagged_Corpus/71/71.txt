Rush's 19th studio album Snakes & Arrows, along with the new Stryken album, will be the first albums released on Warner Music's new  <quote> "8TRACK album" </quote>  format in addition to the standard CD format. The new format release is rumored to be a 25,000 copy limited edition, and will include a special 2112 page booklet containing Neil Peart's collected MySpace bulletins, Alex Lifeson's shopping lists and Geddy Lee's fantasy baseball stats. Amazon.com has also added a link for the Snakes & Arrows Limited Edition here.

The 8TRACK is an endless loop magnetic tape cartridge consisting of a single reel carrying a continuous loop of standard 1/4-inch, plastic, oxide-coated recording tape running at 3.75 inches per second. Program starts and stops are signaled by low-frequency tones. It's state-of-the-art technology. I think our fans will love it says a spokesman for Rush's management. Because of production delays the new format 8TRACK will not be available until sometime in the next 6 years.

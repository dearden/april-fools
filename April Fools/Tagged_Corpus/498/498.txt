MLB Teams Wearing Easter Pastel Colours Today

Major League Baseball players will look a little different as they hop around the bases today.

To mark Easter Sunday, all thirty Major League clubs will be wearing Easter pastel coloured jerseys when they take the field, every team is wearing either pink, purple, yellow, green, or blue versions of their usual home, road or (in a couple of cases) alternate jersey.

Take a look:

There’s a few real winners here, I love some of those powder blue sets (Washington, Philadelphia, St. Louis especially), and that green White Sox jersey… also it just feels like Tampa Bay could use a yellow alternate jersey (they’re co-named for the rays of the sun, afterall).

A closer look at some of my favourites:

On the back of the jersey, the MLB batterman logo will be wearing a set of bunny ears and the baseball has been replaced with an Easter egg:

With Easter Sunday now joining the rotation Major League Baseball now acknowledges six holidays with special uniforms — they already have their players wear special uniforms (caps or jerseys) for five others throughout the year: Mother’s Day, Memorial Day, Father’s Day, and the Fourth of July as well as St. Patrick’s Day during the pre-season schedule.

Teams are expected to just be wearing their usual cap design for the event, reportedly they were unable to have all 30 designs ready in time for April 1st, a date so unusually early in the season to be doing a special uniform event. Maybe next year!

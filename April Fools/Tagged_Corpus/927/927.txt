Not too much room in the executive suite for Bear Stearns bankers now the firm is being taken over by JPMorgan Chase .







Of 26 executives newly named to the top management ranks of JPMorgan’s investment banking and trading businesses, only five are Bear alums.







They are Jeff Urwin, co-head of investment banking; fixed income co-heads Jeff Mayer and Craig Overlander; Mike Nierenberg, head of foreign exchange and rates; and Peter Cherasia, head of global technology and operations.







The appointments were announced in an internal memo from JPMorgan investment bank heads Steven D. Black Stephen Black and William T. Winters Bill Winters , which also announced a reorganization that merges investment banking and M&A with debt and equity underwriting.







Not much surprise in the fact that JPMorgan execs dominate.







Nor that risk management will be firmly in the acquiring bank’s hands. JPMorgan’s John Hogan will be division chief risk officer. Brian Sankey will be global head of credit risk.







Two names noticeably absent from the memo, Alan Schwartz Alan Schwartz , Bear’s chief executive, and Sam Molinaro Sam Molinaro , Bear’s chief financial officer.

Of JPMorgan’s 180,000 staff worldwide, 26,000 are in investment banking and trading. Bear Stearns, the fifth-largest investment bank before it nearly collapsed last month, had 14,000 employees.

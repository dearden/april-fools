This must be the single worst piece of news for any Beliebers.

Justin Bieber has quit his record label.

The Baby singer demanded Island Records terminate his contract after 2 years with the company because he has grown increasingly disillusioned with life in public's eye and terrified by the price of fame.

His spokesperson said:  <quote> "At his request, the record label has agreed to dissolve their working relationship. Now after the release of his multi-platinum My World albums, Justin will have autonomy over his career, without the restrictions of a label." </quote> 

Following his split with the label, Justin Bieber has also announced the cancellation of the rest of his My World Tour dates.

The 17-year-old singer said:  <quote> "My band and I regret to announce that due to circumstances beyond our control we have been forced to cancel the rest of our tour." </quote> 

Fans who have bought his tickets to his concert on April 19 can call this number to get a refund:

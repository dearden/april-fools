The knowledge  <quote> "I'm making sure they use the right acronyms and language," </quote>  says Jessica Negus of her AFP job.

JESSICA NEGUS, just 18 years old and a few months into her career with the federal police, is already playing a pivotal role in some of the biggest and most complex investigations being undertaken by the force.

The daughter of a federal police officer and a graduate of St Clare's College in Canberra, Negus was hired as the AFP's youth adviser under a program devised by the Commissioner, Mick Keelty.

Her job, as might be expected, involves liaising with young people - she hosted her first Youth Forum yesterday. But Ms Negus also helps the AFP's online sleuths to track child porn networks.

For more than two years, AFP officers have been going undercover online, often pretending to be young girls and chatting with perverts. The strategy has already reaped substantial dividends and led to multiple arrests by her colleagues.

 <quote> "I'm helping them out, making sure they use the right acronyms and language, so it seems real," </quote>  Ms Negus said. Her advice includes fashion, iPod downloads and whether uber-brat Corey Worthington is cool or not (he's hip with older teens but considered a jerk by younger internet users).

Her counsel goes right down to making sure the undercover operatives correctly relay the physical characteristics of pre-teen and underage girls.

Kevin Zuccato, head of prevention and innovation at the AFP and Ms Negus's boss, says it's about helping police succeed in an exploding area of criminal activity.

 <quote> "These guys who go online, they do a lot of research. They read Dolly, they work to get the language right so they can hit the right buttons," </quote>  he says.

Ms Negus is from the generation where going online is a natural and instinctive form of communication. In her high school days she spent lots of time on social networking sites and using instant messaging.

She says she was astonished to discover the amount of  <quote> "bad stuff" </quote>  happening online.

 <quote> "It's not just the people online pretending to be other people. There's phishing and there's fraud, and there's lots of it." </quote> 

Phishing involves people posing as financial service companies, sending out fake emails and asking for credit card and bank details. The ability to send huge volumes of emails means only a small fraction of people need to respond for such fraud to succeed.

Federal Agent Zuccato says the new unit is attempting to minimise online crime by adopting the principle that prevention is better than prosecution.

 <quote> "It's your community policing strategy translated to the internet," </quote>  he says.  <quote> "It's a completely new environment and the people who inhabit that world are people of Jessica's generation. You can't have 40- and 50-year-olds driving investigation, laws and policies when they really don't know that much about it." </quote>

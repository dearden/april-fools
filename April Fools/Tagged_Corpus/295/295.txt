Dial-up Internet is enjoying a huge comeback as the slow-net wave (partly inspired by the slow food movement) crashes onto hipster shores nationwide.

OK Go frontman Damian Kulash has written the trend's anthem. The song is called  <quote> "Love Me Longtime." </quote> 
Listen to  <quote> "Love Me Longtime" </quote> 

 <quote> "It's about the Internet when it was a more tactile experience â€” when it took something to be on the Internet," </quote>  Kulash says.

Kulash used dial-up's classic series of tones as supplemental percussion in his ode.  <quote> "That sound is kind of like The Beatles to my parents, it calls back out all the rage and lust and hormones of my youth," </quote>  Kulash tells All Things Considered.  <quote> "Really powerful sound." </quote>

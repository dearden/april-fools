Sadiq Khan today unveiled the election broadcast he hopes will win him four years as Mayor of London.

In the pitch to win voters, Labour's candidate visits the south London council estate where he grew up, takes a journey on a double-decker across the capital, and outlines his overall vision for the capital.

He explains his policies to tackle London’s housing crisis, cut crime and help the NHS during the two and a half minute broadcast – which will air on television on Tuesday evening.

Mr Khan also repeats his pledge to freeze fares until 2020, which his main opponent Conservative Zac Goldsmith has labelled unaffordable.

Mr Khan said:  <quote> “I’m running for Mayor because I want all Londoners to get the opportunities that our city gave to me and my family when I was growing up.

 <quote> "A secure home you can afford, good jobs with decent pay, a modern and affordable transport system, an NHS that puts patients first, fantastic state schools and real action to reduce crime.
 </quote> 
 <quote> “I’ll be a mayor for all Londoners.” </quote> 

Londoners go to the polls on May 5 to vote for Boris Johnson's successor as well as City Hall's London Assembly members.

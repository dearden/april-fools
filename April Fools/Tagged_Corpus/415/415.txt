Not to be outdone by Microsoft and Sony, what with their recent trend of reselling fairly modern games a second time with a new coat of paint, Nintendo hopes to corner the  <quote> "new-old" </quote>  crowd with Superman: Remastered.

 <quote> "We've cornered the retro-resell market for YEARS," </quote>  said Reggie Fils-Aime to The Goofer's Lounge staff Ryan Johnson in a recent interview.  <quote> "I think we could put Super Mario Brothers on a piece of toast and people would play it. We just need proof of concept. Get the toast to say 'do do do da doo doop!' and that'll be enough for a watershed landmark title. But lately, we've seen a region we haven't jumped on: the remaster. Yes, we've put games like Super Mario Galaxy and Metroid Prime Trilogy out for the Wii U, but we keep them as 1:1 releases.  So far the idea of putting out an old game and slapping a couple skins on it and hoping the new system makes it run at a higher frame rate has eluded us." </quote> 

 <quote> "That's why we're digging into the catalog to bring the seminal hit Superman 64 back into the limelight. Since we know this is a system-seller, we'll only be packing this with new Deluxe Editions of the Wii U console. Available starting today, you can go down to your local K-Mart and pick up the Wii U Superman 64 Edition!" </quote> 

Fils-Amie goes on to say:  <quote> "I'd like to thank all our beta testers who helped us bring this idea to fruition. We've been thinking long and hard, and have finally decided on the proper incentives to add to this historical title. If you beat the game once, you can unlock Electric Blue Superman. Run through the game twice, and you can play as Nicholas Cage Superman! In an exclusive deal with the star himself, Nic Cage has recorded new grunts and groans for Superman to use as he picks up heavy cars, hits not-real people, and sighs of discontent as he flies through rings!

The Superman 64 Wii U bundle is out today. Learning from the amiibo fiasco, Nintendo has made plenty of these consoles, touting them as the  <quote> "Unlimited Edition" </quote> ! Feel free to cruise down to K-Mart any time today. I'm sure there'll be one or two on the shelf.

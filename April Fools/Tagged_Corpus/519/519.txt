Weeks ago, writer-filmmaker-actor Tommy Wiseau revealed that he had hopes to bring his cult-classic movie The Room to the Great White Way. Now, TheaterMania has exclusively learned that Wiseau has turned to none other than Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda to make his dream come true.

We have obtained the extremely starry cast list, the key art, and an early version of the song list for Lin-Manuel Miranda's Tommy Wiseau's The Room: The Broadway Musical. As you'll see, it almost has as many songs as Hamilton, and is probably just as epic.

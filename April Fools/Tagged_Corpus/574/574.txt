IS ALAIN de Botton the biggest pseud and poseur of all time, or a brilliant writer who asks intriguing questions? The Guardian has always been pretty clear on the matter:  <quote> "He's an absolute pair-of-aching balls of a man — a slapheaded, ruby-lipped pop philosopher who's forged a lucrative career stating the bleeding obvious." </quote>  But then he has fans like authors Edmund White, Roger Scruton, John Banville, Jan Morris and John Updike, who called him  <quote> "dazzling" </quote> . The weird thing is I find it possible to hold both views about de Botton almost simultaneously.

His new book is called The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work, and immediately provokes the furious question, what do you know about work? De Botton is the son of a fabulously wealthy Swiss financier, has never worked in a factory or shop in his life, and only briefly worked in an office, part-time, when he was making TV documentaries. So when he remarks playfully that a lot of the jobs people do seem rather futile, I want to shake him and say:  <quote> "Not if you have to feed a family." </quote>  At his dilettante worst, he can sound like Prince Charles asking why we can't all be crofters. But then, being infuriating and provocative is part of his job.

Meeting him produces the same sort of confusion. On the one hand, he is friendly, charming and polite; on the other, there is something almost repellent about his politeness. His response to any critical remark is  <quote> "Interesting" </quote> , as if you have made a good debating point. Armed with his Cambridge double first, backed by a phalanx of trusty philosophers — Plato, Seneca, Montaigne, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer — ready to rush to his aid with a supportive quote, it is difficult to get past his cool defences.

The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work is brilliant on the scenery of work — the shipping lanes, the warehouses, the pylons, the office atriums, the airports — but less good on the people. He seems to regard them more as ants. But when I tell him this, he says,  <quote> "Interesting" </quote>  and proceeds to explain why I am wrong. Or when I tell him that he is unnecessarily cruel about some of the people he encounters, such as a careers counsellor, he says:  <quote> "I don't know. He was actually a very nice man, but I think in an impossible job. So rather than being mean about him, I think it was more the wider set-up in which he's operating." </quote>  Really? So then why did he need to print a photograph of the man's modest suburban semi and tell us that  <quote> "at most times of the day the place smelt powerfully of freshly boiled cabbage" </quote> ?

And yet, the book is enormously engaging, even lovable, at times. There is a brilliant scene towards the end when de Botton is in Mojave and finds a sort of elephants' graveyard of decaying aeroplanes. He asks the security man at the gate if he can walk around and the man tells him to f--- off. De Botton delivers a great soliloquy about Goethe and the 18th-century German passion for ruinenlust (love of ruins), and tells him that  <quote> "the disintegrating Continental Airlines 747 visible outside your window seems the equivalent, for myself, of what the Coliseum in Rome must have been for the young Edward Gibbon" </quote> . Whereupon the man tells him to f--- off again and threatens to shoot him. So then de Botton offers $20 bills and the man lets him in.

De Botton spent two years researching the book, travelling from the Maldives to French Guiana as well as the US and Europe with a photographer in tow. He says it was two years of extreme discomfort, both physically (horrible hotels) and psychologically, being stared at as the stranger in the workplace.  <quote> "It was a real challenge, because as a writer I normally spend most of my time in a study, comfortably, and I suppose I wanted to give myself that kick of discomfort — to discover worlds I didn't know." </quote> 

Why did he want to write about work?  <quote> "Partly I think as a kind of intellectual challenge because I think that work doesn't appear in books as much as it should, or in novels, anyway. People fall in love and have sex and that's all they ever do, they never go to the office. Or they're a writer or a psychoanalyst or something … But work is so much more varied than that. I think my book is in praise of the enormous ingenuity that human beings bring to the job of being busy." </quote> 

The irony is that de Botton is one of the few writers who could afford never to work. His father left a huge trust fund (well over £200 million, $A412 million) that he could tap if he ever needed to, but he prefers to live by his writing. His father, Gilbert de Botton, was a Jewish banker, born in Egypt, who moved to Switzerland as head of Rothschild Bank, then founded Global Asset Management in 1983 with £1 million capital and sold it to UBS in 1999 for £420 million.

He was a supremely cultured man who collected late Picassos and was the only person ever to be painted by both Lucian Freud and Francis Bacon. He died in 2000 and has a room at the Tate Modern named in his honour. But he was, according to his son, a  <quote> "tough" </quote>  father.

Having grown up penniless and stateless, entirely self-made, Gilbert never allowed his children, Alain and his sister Miel, to take anything for granted.  <quote> "He was a cruel tyrant as a domestic figure, hugely overbearing, and there were constant attempts to make sure that we understood the value of absolutely everything. So in many ways we were less privileged than children in an ordinary middle-class family." </quote> 

His father, having spent his childhood in Egypt when it was a British protectorate, also had an exaggerated respect for English education and sent de Botton to board at the Dragon School in Oxford when he was only eight. He spoke no English, having grown up in Switzerland:  <quote> "It was miserable. I was foreign and Jewish, with a funny name, and was very small and hated sport … So the way to get round it was to become the school joker, which I did quite effectively. I was always fooling around to make the people who would otherwise dump me in the loo laugh." </quote> 

He failed to get into Eton, but went to Harrow and then Cambridge, getting a double first in history before doing a master of philosophy and starting a PhD. But he found Cambridge a disappointment. He went there hoping to fall in love, to make hundreds of friends, and to be taught by brilliant teachers.  <quote> "None of those things happened — I didn't fall in love in a transforming way, I wasn't taught brilliantly and I didn't make hundreds of friends. But it was a good time for thinking and working out what I wanted to do. I didn't find the history course particularly challenging, so I just spent all my time reading things that were not on the course syllabus. And started writing." </quote>  The result was his brilliantly original Essays in Love, published when he was 23.

How did his father feel about Alain becoming a writer?  <quote> "Very conflicted. He was a big reader, he wanted to write, he was passionate about writing … and one of the ways in which we could communicate was through books. I think in a way it made him very happy, but also totally envious, so I'd get very odd responses from him. I wrote four books in his lifetime and with each one he would manage to say something absolutely vile — I remember him in earshot saying, 'I don't think he's succeeded with this one' — and it was tough to hear. But then I learnt that he'd sent copies of my books to his friends, so … it was a strange and schizophrenic, very troubled relationship." </quote> 

After Essays in Love, de Botton published another two semi-autobiographical semi-novels, The Romantic Movement (1994) and Kiss and Tell (1995), which he says he now prefers to forget. It was his next book, How Proust Can Change Your Life (1997), that made him a world bestseller, thanks to a rave review from John Updike in The New Yorker.

Proust and its successor, The Consolations of Philosophy (2000), established what de Botton was really about — writing what were effectively self-help books designed to encourage readers to think for themselves and not regurgitate received ideas. He restored philosophy to a lay audience, much to the fury of academic philosophers who always wanted to keep the subject as dry and impenetrable as possible.

Was he attracted to philosophy by a need to think through his own problems?  <quote> "Yes. My writing always came out of a very personal place, out of an attempt to stay sane. I might not have understood that, or admitted that once, but actually now I think, well, why not? Yes, it is self-therapy. And if other people find value in it, it's precisely on that basis." </quote> 

Although de Botton seems very confident now — he turns 40 this year — he says any confidence is recently gained. As a child, he was too shy to look anyone in the eye. As a teenager, he was  <quote> "quite puppyishly keen to make friends and never quite understanding why that didn't happen. I was an incredibly lonely, very alienated teenager." </quote>  Also, he started losing his hair very young, at 20, which reinforced his anxieties and made him even less confident with girls. It also made him think about ageing, which is unusual at 20.

He had a pattern of falling in love with girls but then going off them when they showed signs of loving him back. The problem was only solved with two years of psychotherapy in his early 30s.  <quote> "I learnt a lot. I learnt to stop fantasising about the perfect job or the perfect relationship because that can actually be an excuse for not living. I was full of youthful romanticism, which teeters on solipsism and a kind of narcissism. So I think I possibly wouldn't have been able to get married and have children if I hadn't had some of those very earth-shattering conversations." </quote> 

He met his wife, Charlotte, in 2001 in a typically quirky de Bottonian way. He was talking with friends late at night and someone asked him to describe his ideal girlfriend, so he did, in great detail, and  <quote> "miraculously, one person in the room took note of this and introduced me to Charlotte the very next weekend" </quote> .

He said his ideal girlfriend had to be a doctor's daughter who grew up outside London and worked in business or science, all of which Charlotte was.  <quote> "She was a businesswoman, she'd started her own company, she knew how to create an Excel spreadsheet or run a payroll. She can do all these things that I can't do." </quote> 

Why a doctor's daughter?  <quote> "I like the values associated with a medical family — common sense, being practical but also thoughtful." </quote>  And why growing up outside London?  <quote> "Oh, you know, a suspicion of metropolitan values and, in me, an Orwellian desire for something more grounded. I think partly because I'd observed in my parents' life a kind of unpleasantness that can come at the top of society. My father, because he needed to find investors in his business, had to spend a lot of time sucking up to rich people. And I rather ran away from that. I was interested in the idea of 'the normal', and I thought the country was more normal." </quote> 

Despite being firmly settled in England, he still comes over as foreign, and his books often sell better abroad. But he writes and speaks perfect English so the foreignness is a bit of a mystery. Partly, it's his exquisite manners and neat appearance, but also a constant need for deep, meaningful conversations. He says his wife often gets irritated when he launches in at breakfast and she says:  <quote> "Look, I can't deal with this now, save it for later." </quote>  But he has a friend in Australia who will ring up and say without preamble,  <quote> "What is shyness?" </quote> , which is his idea of a good conversation.

At dinner parties he likes to launch a topic ( <quote> "What is the best form of government?" </quote> ) rather than make small talk. Or he asks people questions until they get irritated. He complains:  <quote> "There is a coldness in English social life. No one reveals anything, says anything that is in any way naked, vulnerable, interesting, honest, and that does frustrate me." </quote> 

So what will de Botton do next? He has already started his next book. But he is keen to move beyond books, to develop other projects, especially the School of Life that he set up last year in Bloomsbury. It is a former shop with books for sale on the ground floor and a big salon downstairs where he and his fellow teachers hold seminars on subjects such as love, politics, work. The aim of the school is to teach  <quote> "ideas to live by" </quote>  or, he says,  <quote> "to inspire people to change their lives through culture" </quote> . Doesn't it attract loads of nutters?  <quote> "That was a fear at the beginning and there are a few who want to come in every day and sit and talk, but it's only maybe 10 people who've caused trouble." </quote>  He hopes that eventually there can be Schools of Life all round the world; they have already had offers to open branches in New York and Australia, but feel they want to  <quote> "road-test" </quote>  the idea a bit longer.

Does he have some secret desire to be an entrepreneur, to make a fortune like his father? He admits to envying friends who have started their own businesses. I assumed he learnt about business from his father but he says, on the contrary,  <quote> "he mystified it" </quote> .

 <quote> "He made it seem like something I'd never get my head round — don't go near this, this is my patch. So he made jokes about my inability to understand maths, and, sure enough, I soon fell into line and didn't understand anything about maths. So it's an area that now, as an adult, I'm tremendously curious about, something I might have a talent for that got suppressed. That's why I look at entrepreneurs and think, hey, perhaps I deserve to be at this table, too.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "And also I'm often struck by the fear that books don't do very much. I think they're the most important things in the world, but I also think who's going to read them, and could one get the message across in another way, maybe on the web, or by making a film, or getting involved in the school? And that's where the entrepreneurship comes in — how can you spread ideas? What I want to do is make a difference." </quote>

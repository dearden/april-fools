Back in Australia a 15-year-old kid called Adam Scott was part of the breakfast bash at Royal Queensland Golf Club. He began to feel sick. Older men turned away from the television set.

On the screen a dead man was walking through Amen Corner as his blood seeped down the bright green bank and into the dyed blue water of the creek.

Of course that's melodramatic. But watching Greg Norman's challenge for the 1996 Masters implode was the JFK moment for many golf fans. We all remember where we were when Norman turned a victory march into the death scene from Camille. It was horrific and it was fascinating. And that was just the front nine.

When Norman's ball trickled all the way back down the hill in front of the ninth green, the Great White Shark looked more like a middle-aged man with motion sickness. He was almost albino from the strain of it all and he began to grip the golf club tighter and tighter. The great Aussie golfer Peter Thomson said:  <quote> "It's a wonder the shaft didn't buckle." </quote> 

Imagine what it must have been like for Norman's family. As Nick Faldo closed in for the kill, Norman three-putted the 11th green from close range and then dumped his tee shot at the next hole into the water. On the bank behind the tee Norman's then wife Laura and daughter Morgan looked on from among the stricken crowd.

In her biography of Norman written in the aftermath, Lauren St John describes mother and daughter as  <quote> "clinging to each other on the rise above the short 12th like the hypnotised witnesses of a car crash" </quote> .

As he lay amid the wreckage a few hours later Norman said:  <quote> "God, I'd love to be putting the green jacket on. But it's not the end of my life. I'm not going to fall off the face of the earth because of what happened to me." </quote> 

Now Norman is back. After a warm-up in Houston a couple of days ago, Norman is returning to play the Masters for the first time since 2002. He says:  <quote> "There's that great saying: 'Do you want to fly like a buzzard or soar like an eagle?' If you want to soar like an eagle, you've got to take control." </quote> 

The trouble is that Greg tends to soar like a buzzard. He gets higher and higher and then finds he cannot quite support his own body weight and falls to earth.

It wasn't always his fault. The chip that Larry Mize holed at the 1987 Masters to beat Norman in a play-off was one of the flukiest shots in the history of golf. But more often than not, as his fellow Australian Jack Newton once said:  <quote> "Greg does all the right things until the head comes off and the turnip goes on." </quote> 

'No-worries' Norman's response?  <quote> "I know people kind of always revert to the negative, and I always go back to the positive. They are like, 'Why didn't this course destroy Greg Norman?' I'm going back because I love it, I love playing." </quote> 

The miracle of Augusta was that Norman turned his darkest hour into thousands of flickering candles of hope. From all over the world messages rushed in congratulating Norman on his dignity in defeat. Even snotty kids wrote letters of tribute. Norman became like the commander-in-chief of losers.

Imagine if Norman went back to Augusta this week and won a tournament that no Aussie has ever won. There are seven in the field this year and Geoff Ogilvy, the highest ranked of them, says:  <quote> "We have got enough great players now.
 </quote> 
We have got a handful of guys at least that could win there this year. <quote> " Maybe Ogilvy did not have Norman in the palm of his hand when he came up with that calculation – but what if?
 </quote> 
Butch Harmon was Norman's coach that fateful day back in 1996 – so what if, Butch?

Harmon says:  <quote> "How ironic would it be for Greg Norman to go back after all these years and win the Masters. I'm not sure it's going to happen, but it sure would be something. He knows Augusta very well. It's a course that's always suited his game. I can't wait to see it happen." </quote> 

And so Norman boards the private plane at the same little airport where 13 years ago he told his family and friends:  <quote> "I'm sorry I let you all down." </quote>  But this time he's wearing a green jacket. Yes sir, the second miracle of Augusta, that sure would be something.

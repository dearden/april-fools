Cape Town – An  <quote> “altogether less severe” </quote>  repeat of Kamp Staaldraad will precede the Springboks’ departure for the 2011 World Cup, with controversial former coach Rudolf Straeuli roped in temporarily to lead the week-long training exercise.

SA Rugby head of communications Andy Colquhoun confirmed exclusively to Sport24 early on Friday that Straeuli, who spearheaded the first Staaldraad ahead of the 2003 RWC, had agreed to take charge of the team-building camp at a secret bushveld location on abandoned Spoornet property.

Straeuli is presently employed by the Sharks as their commercial manager, and the franchise have agreed to briefly release him to the Boks.

The hefty, Test-capped loose forward said he had  <quote> “learnt from certain tactical errors” </quote>  at the maiden Staaldraad.

And SA Rugby are keen to stress that none of the various military-trained personalities who supervised the much-publicised 2003  <quote> “boot camp” </quote>  will be involved this time, although Straeuli has enlisted, with the rugby bosses’ blessing, the help of former Koevoet commander General Gerhardus  <quote> “Aard” </quote>  Vark for Staaldraad II.

Colquhoun said the follow-up would also not include any of the  <quote> “psychological terror” </quote>  aspects that marked the 2003 Staaldraad, when ice-cold water was poured on the naked squad in a dark pit, loose forward Joe van Niekerk struggled to slaughter a chicken intended for communal consumption and the players were pitted against each other in bare-knuckle boxing bouts.

 <quote> “There will be a certain ‘survival’ factor, but nothing like as punishing as 2003,” </quote>  said Colquhoun.  <quote> “This time, for example, each player will know well in advance his daily diet for the week: they will be given a handful of rosemary at dawn and 115ml of a soya-based energy drink after dark.
 </quote> 
 <quote> “And instead of being subjected to repeated recordings of ‘God Save the Queen’ or ‘God Defend New Zealand’, the players will be more positively motivated on this occasion by large-screen re-runs of events like Ras Dumisani’s rendition of our own national anthem in Toulouse and Sonny Bill Williams’ unpunished shoulder into the front six teeth of Ryan Kankowski at Twickenham last Sunday.” </quote> 

Straeuli and current Springbok coach Peter de Villiers, who fully endorses Staaldraad II, will oversee it closely with binoculars from the back of a specially adapted game-drive vehicle, with De Villiers promising to participate personally in  <quote> “certain of the exercises” </quote> .

He would not specify which these would be, although he was in ebullient mood as he quipped to Sport24:  <quote> “I’ve told Rudolf I plan to spot the big five through the trees first ... Andries Bekker.” </quote>

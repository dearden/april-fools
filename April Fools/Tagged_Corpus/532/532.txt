Trundle went from hero to villain after Swansea's victory

A South Wales Police statement to the Press Association said that both men had been bailed until the end of April.

The statement read:  <quote> "South Wales Police have arrested a 23-year-old man and a 29-year-old man on suspicion of section four public order offences." </quote> 

The two players will also face FA of Wales disciplinary action.

A statement issued by the FAW said that  <quote> "charges will be issued" </quote> , although whether this will involve a playing ban or a fine remains to be seen.

FAW secretary general David Collins said that Swansea City have 10 days to respond to the charges levelled against Trundle and Tate, which gives them until 15 April.

South Wales Police have yet to officially charge either of the two players following a flood of complaints.

Trundle, captain Roberto Martinez and Tate brandished a flag bearing graphic insults aimed at Cardiff.

Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins has apologised for the players' actions but the FAW has decided to take a firm stance.

I'll be taking this seriously, we'll have to deal with it

 <quote> "The images paraded by Swansea City players were of an extremely offensive and insulting nature," </quote>  said the FAW.

 <quote> "Such behaviour is totally unacceptable." </quote> 

Trundle, 29, struck a spectacular opening goal in the 2-1 win over Carlisle at the Millennium Stadium.

But he and his team-mates were photographed brandishing insults towards Cardiff City during the post-match celebrations at the Millennium Stadium.

Trundle, who also wore a T-shirt which had a cartoon of a man urinating on a Cardiff shirt, has refused to comment on his actions.

Swansea chairman Jenkins said Trundle's actions were inexcusable and believed it  <quote> "could be something that Lee lives to regret" </quote> .

The 29-year-old striker and Tate met the club solicitor on Tuesday to prepare statements which were then made available to the police.

A statement on the club's official website said both players wished to apologise to those offended by their actions and stressed there was  <quote> "no malice intended" </quote> .

One would hope that it was just over-exuberance on the part of the players

Football League spokesman John Nagle

But Jenkins added:  <quote> "It's certainly something I can't defend. We regret any offence that occurred.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "Maybe it was a heat-of-the-moment thing. Lee will probably wish that this hadn't happened. I just hope that it doesn't cause any animosity between the two sets of fans.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "I'll be taking this seriously, we'll have to deal with it." </quote> 

The Football League also condemned the actions of the Swansea players.

 <quote> "We absolutely deplore these actions," </quote>  said Football League head of communications John Nagle.

 <quote> "One would hope that it was just over-exuberance on the part of the players after winning the Football League Trophy. However, that is still little excuse.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "League clubs are working hard to encourage more families and more young supporters to matches and it is important that players recognise their wider responsibility to the game when they are in these situations." </quote>

Just hours after acquiring BitTorrent Incorporated for $53bn in cash and stock, Comcast has shutdown the tiny San Francisco company, assuring customers and shareholders that its doors will never reopen.

Last week, the big-name American ISP told the world it would find a way of managing its cable network without discriminating against BitTorrent and other peer-to-peer traffic. But the fix has come much sooner than expected.

 <quote> "There were two ways forward," </quote>  said Comcast executive vice president David Cohen in a canned statement.  <quote> "We could either reconfigure our network to treat BitTorrent like any other application or buy BitTorrent Inc. and do our best to destroy the entire protocol. At $53bn, destroying the protocol was the cheaper option." </quote> 

Cohen said the company also intends to purchase Apple and IBM, with an eye on destroying both iChat and Lotus Notes – two other applications Comcast has been unable to manage without annoying all but three other people on the planet.  <quote> "Buying Apple will cost us a pretty penny," </quote>  Cohen explained.  <quote> "But it’s still cheaper than letting iChat run like it’s supposed to run." </quote> 

The Federal Trade Commission has yet to approve Comcast’s acquisition of BitTorrent, but Comcast doesn’t care.  <quote> "We approved the deal on our own," </quote>  the company told The Wall Street Journal.  <quote> "Congress doesn't empower the FTC to approve mergers and acquisitions involving Comcast or any other company that has no respect for government authority." </quote> 

After rubber-stamping its own deal, Comcast promptly fired BitTorrent’s entire staff, razed its offices, unplugged its data center, and forced founder Bram Cohen to change his name.  <quote> "I will not be confused with a bandwidth hog," </quote>  said David Cohen.

When we phoned Comcast for comment, a company spokesman denied that we existed. When we assured him that we did, he said  <quote> "That’s not what I’m told." </quote> 

Yes, BitTorrent Inc. oversees only a portion of BitTorrent traffic on the net, but according to independent researcher Jake Gittes, Comcast has also been systematically poisoning BitTorrent users for nearly a year and a half.  <quote> "I first noticed the bodies in late 2006," </quote>  Gittes told us.  <quote> "And by the spring, I could prove Comcast was killing almost 300 file-sharers a month." </quote> 

Speaking to The Journal, Comcast acknowledged the killings, but it preferred to call them  <quote> "reasonable network management" </quote>

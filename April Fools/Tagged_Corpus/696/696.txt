As any hopeless romantic can tell you, there is often a high price to be paid for falling in love. And if you happen to be a teenage chart sensation, the bill for Cupid's arrow could run into millions of pounds.

British chanteuse Joss Stone may be jeopardising her seven-figure advertising contract with Gap by moving in with her boyfriend. The 17-year-old has clearly fallen head over heels for LA music producer Beau Dozier, but she is still under the legal age of consent for California, and her decision to set up home with the 25-year-old has provoked a storm of controversy Stateside.

Although Joss's representatives insist  <quote> "she's not living or staying with her boyfriend â€“ she's in the care of his family" </quote> , the row has caused a furore in the American press and some experts say the Gap deal may be under threat.

Beau, who is the son of legendary Motown songwriter Lamont Dozier, could also face prosecution if authorities choose to stick to the strict letter of the law. And the fact that Joss has taken to wearing a promise ring in declaration of her feelings has only served to intensify interest in the romance.

The Devon-born singer first met Beau last year after she was introduced to his father. Around that time she also fired her mother as manager, clearing the way for Lamont to take charge of her career.

The performer has made her feelings pretty clear on the sleeve notes of her new album:  <quote> "Beau, I love u for u," </quote>  she wrote.  <quote> "U are truly blessed in many different ways. Thank u for creating so many different things. Truly u are amazing! Thank u for sharing your heart with me. I love u. I love u. I love u." </quote>

Lake Van is the largest lake in Turkey, located in the far east of the country.

The Lake Van Monster was not reported until 1995. There are now more than 1,000 people claiming to have witnessed the beast which is reported to measure around fifteen meters long with spikes on its back and appears similar to a Plesiosaur or Ichthyosaurus. Following these reports, the Turkish government sent an official scientific survey group to the lake who failed to spot the creature.

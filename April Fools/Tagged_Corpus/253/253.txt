We get a lot of news, commentary and quotes here in the IGN offices, but today something interesting happened in the comic book industry. It seems one writer has managed to upset so many creators that finally the industry, almost in unison, is standing up to say  <quote> "enough is enough." </quote>  Their target? Identity Crisis, Green Arrow and Justice League of America writer Brad Meltzer.

Here are the quotes various creators contacted us to provide. Their list of complaints are wide and varied. Better start buying some flowers and chocolates, Brad. You have a lot of people to try and win over...

Garth Ennis:  <quote> "Oh God, Meltzer again. I'm not 100% sure that the drivel this wretched ex-catamite produces is bad for western civilisation, but I know it's bad for me." </quote> 

John Cassaday:  <quote> "I get along with Brad very well, but the way he treats his public is appalling. It's one thing to read chapters from a new book at a store signing, it's another for that book to be 'The History of Dirt.'" </quote> 

Bob Schreck:  <quote> "Meltzer's run on Green Arrow was an absolute abomination! I invited him to the party solely because of the numbers I knew he'd bring... Face it Brad... we're both whores." </quote> 

Allan Heinberg:  <quote> "Brad Meltzer writes as if telling a suspenseful story, grounding it in emotional truth, and grandly entertaining the audience is all that matters in contemporary fiction. Until he writes solely for the critics who govern the so-called literary establishment, Meltzer will have to content himself with merely selling millions of books and making millions of devoted readers deliriously happy." </quote> 

Phil Hester:  <quote> "Meltzer has packed more clich√©s, hackneyed plot twists, and feeble minded characterizations into his relatively short, but bewilderingly uninterrupted career than most writers find possible in a lifetime. The damage he's done to comics, an art form he purports to love, is incalculable, and will take generations to repair." </quote> 

Neil Gaiman:  <quote> "Dear Brad, I'll never forget what a joy it was to meet you at the White House Breakfast. I was just sad that it had to end so soon. Honestly, in retrospect, letting the secret service know you'd made it into the building and within shooting distance of the president, again, might have been a mistake. I should have waited until you'd finished your coffee." </quote> 

J.H. Williams III:  <quote> "Meltzer just swims around in the comicbook muck and produces the most astounding work of slimy residue that can be found off the bottom of my shoe!" </quote> 

Paul Levitz:  <quote> "Brad has labored mightily to add verisimilitude to comics, bringing sex crimes, paranoia, and twisting characters older than he is claiming to make the stories more suspenseful. Hate to tell you, but some of us liked our comics sweet and harmless. (And by the way, Superman's not real...but if he was, he'd be there to blow out your birthday candles with you.)" </quote>

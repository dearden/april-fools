Hipsters, now you can playback your website statistics while you enjoy a fresh cup of that crazy expensive coffee bean each morning.

Google has just released a new feature in Google Analytics that allows you to express your inner rock god by playing back your site statistics as though they were staves on parchment. You have the choice of two different instruments, the fairly pedestrian piano, and a rather exotic sounding sitar.

I must admit, I was sceptical at first, but after listening to a few staves of a site I’m currently working on, I could really hear the nuances!

I’m not sure how long the feature will last, but hopefully they will realise the benefit of listening to your stats while doing things like housework and taking cat pictures.

I am bursting here, people! I was just emailed a link to this press release that went out yesterday. Why didn't anyone tell me sooner??? 8-D We have our old Diet Dew back.

PURCHASE, N.Y. (PRNewswire) - PURCHASE, N.Y., March 31 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, in response to overwhelming consumer demand, Pepsi announced it will reintroduce its previous formula for Diet Mountain Dew as  <quote> "Diet Mountain Dew Subzero" </quote>  on May 31, 2006.

Diet Mountain Dew was recently revamped with a new taste featuring a blend of sweeteners including Aspartame, Sucralose and ASK (Acesulfame Potassium). The reformulation was met with much fanfare and packages of the product were stamped with the slogan  <quote> "Tuned Up Taste" </quote> .

 <quote> "We've received very positive feedback on the Tuned Up Taste of Diet Mountain Dew, but were surprised at the volume of consumers who still crave the original formula. We had planned on reintroducing it as a new product late this fall, but have decided to move up production to show our appreciation to our loyal customers," </quote>  says Frank Cooper, vice president of flavored soft drinks, Pepsi-Cola North America. Cooper was also quoted as saying,  <quote> "April Fools, chumps!" </quote>  He then hopped into a waiting stretch limo, went home, drank a Big Gulp-sized martini laced with flecks of gold, and took a nap in a large nest fashioned from several million dollars in tens and twenties.

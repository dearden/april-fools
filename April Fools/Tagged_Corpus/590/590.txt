Two Bowling Green Police Department officers received medals for their efforts to save the life of a dispatcher’s daughter during a December automobile crash.

Officer James Peerce and Sgt. Shane West were each given the Lifesaving Medal on Friday during the department’s annual awards ceremony for 2007.

West and Peerce were among those who responded to the Dec. 16, 2007, accident involving Officer Lisa Brown and Lakoi Bailey, 18, of Bowling Green, whose mother is a dispatcher for city police.

Peerce held Bailey’s head until help arrived. Doctors from The Medical Center and Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville told the family that Peerce prevented Bailey from having a spinal cord injury and possibly dying, according to a letter from Bailey’s mother, Angela Prude.

West said he held Bailey’s body while Peerce held her head to prevent her from moving.

 <quote> “In a lot of cases, we never know if we made a difference. In this case, I was able to see her mother and I know we made a difference,” </quote>  West said.

Responders’ efforts allowed Bailey to go home to her mother, he said.

It was a very stressful situation, Peerce said. But West maintained control and continued to give orders.

Bailey presented West and Peerce with their awards.

 <quote> “It was great to be able to thank the people who saved my life,” </quote>  she said.

This situation was particularly stressful because both vehicles involved were part of the police department family, Chief Doug Hawkins said.

Meanwhile, Officer Matt Davis was chosen as the department’s officer of the year.

It was a great honor to even be considered for the award because of the caliber of officers in the department, Davis said.

 <quote> “It’s overwhelming to receive the award,” </quote>  he said.

Dispatcher Jennifer Edwards was named civilian employee of the year, while Ernie Steff received the  <quote> “Character Counts” </quote>  award.

Officer Alex Wright won the DUI award with 85 arrests of those driving under the influence. Officer Todd Porter was given the Bill Key traffic award after issuing 435 citations in 2007.

Officer David Hall received the seatbelt award for issuing 150 seat belt violation citations during the year.

West also earned the child restraint award with 7 citations.

 <quote> “This is an area where we have to do better next year,” </quote>  Hawkins said.  <quote> “I’m challenging someone to write more than that this year.” </quote> 

Marie Witty was also provided a 35-year service award for her work as a school crossing guard.

 <quote> “It’s tough to do anything for 35 years,” </quote>  Hawkins said.

Capt. Glen Bratcher and crossing guard Comelia Hunter were given 20-year service awards.

The shock announcement was made on Saturday morning, saying that the 52-year-old Good Morning Britain host would be giving the president advice on how best to handle the negativity he has been receiving from the film industry.

Piers added that Donald got in touch seeking his help after being openly criticised by Meryl Streep at the Golden Globes ceremony in January.

A source close to Piers said: ‘This is a match made in heaven. President Trump urgently needs guidance when it comes to making a positive impression in the showbusiness world.

‘Piers’ background makes him the perfect choice for this role, and hopefully if they work together they can find a way to make the president’s reputation great again.’

The insider went on to reveal that Piers’ role will include teaching the prez how to use moderate language on Twitter, saying that his distinguished background in journalism will come in very handy when teaching him how to use proper grammar.

It’s thought that Piers will begin his advisory stint in the White House later this year, thus giving President Trump the chance to increase his popularity within the industry before the next major awards season rolls around.

The source added: ‘Hopefully this means the President will be getting a few thumbs up from the celebrity world on those red carpets next year.’

Piers recently quit Twitter to raise money for Comic Relief. You can still donate, head here to do so.

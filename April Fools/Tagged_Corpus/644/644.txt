Converge Media Group, the management, production and branded entertainment company founded last year by actor/writer/comedian JB Smoove, Rick Dorfman, Conan Smith and Adam Benowitz, has signed a first-look reality TV deal with newly launched Storyville Entertainment. This is the first co-production deal for both companies and will give Storyville access to develop and produce unscripted and branded opportunities for Converge’s comedic clientele. That list includes Smoove, Rich Vos, Lynne Koplitz, Pete Dominic, Chris DiStefano, Carly Aquillino as well as producers Ryan Ling (Guy Code, Girl Code) and P.J. Morrison (Impractical Jokers, Restaurant Stakeout), and writers such as Frank Santopadre (The Joy Behar Show, The View).



Storyville’s Betsy Schechter and Converge’s Smoove, Dorfman, Smith and Benowitz will serve as executive producers for all sales.

Since its launch last year Converge has produced Four Courses With JB Smoove and utilized their talent in marketing campaigns for Pepsi, Gillette, Microsoft and Gillette among others. Storyville is currently in production on a music-based documentary series for MTV International and in development on non-scripted and scripted projects for A&E, TNT, H2, MTVI and Animal Planet.

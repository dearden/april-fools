I didn't believe this until I did further research, but I am pleased--and excited--to announce that Disney Animation has green-lit a brand-new movie: Eragon!

Eragon was previously made into a film in 2006, but drew poor critical reception. Despite this, it was the 16th highest-grossing film of the year. However, many moviegoers--fans of the book and otherwise--were disappointed with this take of the Eragon story. Author Christopher Paolini is quoted as saying,  <quote> "The movie was horrible. I wish it had never been made." </quote> 

Disney executive Robert Iger approached Paolini to remake Eragon, as well as purchasing the rights for potential sequels should Eragon do well at the box office. So far, Paolini has been fascinated with the idea of a remake.  <quote> "I always dreamed of Alagaesia [the land in which Eragon takes place] to be dream-like, and with animation, I can't wait to see that effect." </quote> 

Eragon is the first story in the Inheritance Cycle. The three sequels are Eldest, Brisingr, and the recently-announced Inheritance. The contract Paolini signed will have Eragon being released in Christmas 2015, Eldest in 2017, and Brisingr and Inheritance being released sometime in the early 2020s.

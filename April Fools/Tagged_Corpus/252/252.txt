Households that already have access to ADSL2+ won't get a fibre upgrade under the NBN, according to a shock announcement on ABC radio last night by Stephen Conroy. The move is claimed to reduce the cost of rolling out the NBN from $43bn to just $23bn.

The news comes as the Federal Government comes under increased pressure regarding the price tag placed on the NBN. It will also get the government back in the good graces of Telstra shareholders, angry after attempts to split the telco in two in preparation for the fibre network.

When challenged about the real world performance of ADSL2+ lines, Conroy would not get into specifics.  <quote> "Figures just released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that almost two million households right now are getting between 8 and 24 megabits with ADSL2" </quote> , he claimed.  <quote> "Experts from the entertainment industry tell me that is easily capable of next generation applications such as IPTV." </quote> 

But the comments only raise more questions for consumers. Not all ADSL2+ lines are created equal, with actual performance anywhere between 1.5Mbit/s and 24Mbit/s. It is not clear if the government will go by exchange, or if those not reaching a certain ADSL2+ speed will still be eligible for fibre. In a cruel twist, it appears as though those in regional areas could end up with faster broadband than those living in the CBD.

Opposition telecommunications spokesman Tony Smith told Australian IT that this was the nail in the coffin for the Rudd NBN.  <quote> "Wireless technologies are already working past 100 megabits and the Rudd Government's fibre plan is already out of date" </quote> , he said.  <quote> "This further back-pedalling proves that the NBN is simply policy on the run for Labor as usual." </quote> 

 <quote> "The Coalition will be looking to implement a very different, responsible and targeted approach that will be designed to deliver better, affordable, reliable broadband services where they are needed without a reckless waste of taxpayer's funds, as well as encouraging the private sector to upgrade broadband infrastructure," </quote>  Smith said.

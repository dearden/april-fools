Kidrobot appears to making serious waves with their 'special edition' Dunny releasesâ€¦ First there was the Chauskaskis designed  <quote> "Birro the Clown," </quote>  then the recently announced  <quote> "Arlequine" </quote>  by Koralie, and now an as-yet-untitled one by UK street artist Banksy!

Yesterday, a literal chimpanzee dressed as postal worker showed up on my front door, handing me a strange envelope before departing. Inside the envelope was a cassette tape which, when I found an old school tape deck to play it upon, contained a digitally manipulated voice claiming to be Banksy. I was further informed that the artist had been secretly working with Kidrobot to produce a Dunny the likes of which we'd never seen before: made at a height of 4 <quote> " rather than the normal 3" </quote> , with the tall rabbit ears shifted to the sides of the head & reformed as perfect half-circles, and the head itself not quite as round, made more akin to a real face. But, best of all, it would be stark white, a statement in and upon itself. Dying for a picture? So were we! And, thankfully, Banksy provided a teaser into the package (as seen above)... Wow, simply wow. Groundbreaking, one might even say. Like nothing we've ever seen before. This will be a Dunny for the ages!

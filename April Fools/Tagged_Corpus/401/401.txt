In a surprise early announcement, CBS Chief Les Moonves laid out the network’s Fall 2014 schedule today. Claiming the Tiffany network had a formula for success and rarely failed when it stuck with that formula.

He declared that going forward that the CBS primetime schedule would consist only of shows that were spinoffs of other CBS shows, effectively ending new show creative development at the network.

 <quote> “Just like Henry Ford would sell you any color Model T as long as it was black, you can watch any show you want on CBS, as long as it’s a near copy of another CBS show.” </quote>

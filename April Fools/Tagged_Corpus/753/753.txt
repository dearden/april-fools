It’s a year to go till Brexit day. By this time next year, Britain will have left the European Union. Although to be fair it probably won’t feel like it, because if all goes according to plan we will immediately enter a two-year standstill or status quo transition period during which everything will be pretty much exactly the same as it is now.

But still, 29 March 2019 is a significant date: the UK, if you believe the Brexiters, will have  <quote> “taken back control” </quote>  of its borders, its laws and its money, in principle if not yet in practice; and for the EU, a member state will have left the bloc for the first time in its history. So this was what you might call a pre-anniversary (if that’s a word?) and as the media likes to do with all anniversaries, there was a veritable avalanche of programmes and articles and columns last week to mark the occasion. Not that we’re any the wiser, of course, about what Brexit will actually look like when it finally happens – that’s still as clear as mud, and a lot could happen over the coming 12 months to change what  <quote> “Brexit means Brexit” </quote>  (to coin a phrase) means.

With Jon Henley to chew over what’s happened so far and take a few educated guesses about what might be to come are the Brexit Means… regular pundits Dan Roberts, the Guardian’s Brexit policy editor, and the Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin.

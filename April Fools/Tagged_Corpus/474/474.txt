Horses will be allowed­ to wear hi-tech headphones playing music as they compete in next Saturday’s­ Grand National.

Race fans might exclaim: Hoof do you think you’re kidding?

But the surprise decision by racing bosses could revolutionise the sport.

Global music streaming service Deezer has been working with leading trainers for months, with a view to using the technology next season to give horses extra zip as they gallop along.

A spokesman for the Jockey Club – not the Jokey Club – insisted:  <quote> “We always think there’s a place for fresh ideas.” </quote> 

The decision to allow headphones was music to the ears of Deezer spokeswoman­ Avril Foal, who said:  <quote> “We’re delighted.” </quote> 

If the trial at Aintree is judged a success, ’phones could become as commonplace in races as blinkers and nose bands.

Irish gelding Perfect Candidate, trained by Fergal O’Brien, is to become the first horse in Aintree’s 178-year history to sport the audio gear.

Cotwolds-based Fergal has been busy experimenting­ on the gallops with hurdlers Pinch Punch and Youmustbejoking­. Impressed by their geed-up perfor­mances­, he is now ready to send fancied Perfect Candidate out in the hi-tech headgear.

He grinned:  <quote> “Now all I’ve got to do is finalise my playlist.” </quote> 

It is rumoured that as his steed nears Becher’s Brook, Aintree’s famed hurdle, Fergal has tweaked the device to play Jump, by US rockers Van Halen.

College looking for 'fierce face' to be live mascot at events

In a bold move Wednesday, Luther College announced the school will trade in the beloved Norse mascot and logo for a new, fierce face for the college.

The logo and mascot change was instigated by retiring Athletic Director Joe Thompson,  <quote> "This spring I'll be retiring, and one of the things I've been interested in doing is changing the mascot at Luther College. We feel that we need to make a more fierce face that represents and embodies the spirit at Luther College, and we feel the Fighting Gnome is our answer." </quote> 

The last time the college changed mascots was in the 1970s when the college's Norsemen became the Norse to incorporate the female element of the student body.

The current idea of the Fighting Gnome attempted to stay true to the college's Norwegian roots. The first names suggested were the Grounded Nisse, the Happy Nisse, and the Fighting Nisse after Scandinavian story tale creature, the  <quote> "Nisse" </quote> -a human-like creature, small in size with an immense strength. After hours of deliberation, the mascot and logo board decided on the Fighting Gnome insteadâ€¦ because it was easier to find gnome-themed goods and let's be honest, it just sounded cooler.

Auditions are being held for the person, or persons, who will be the live mascot at Luther events for the 2015-16 academic year. Interested persons should apply in person at the Campus News and Visual Media office located on the second floor of Dahl Centennial Union.

 <quote> "We've been holding auditions to find our Fighting Gnome. Our Fighting Gnome must reflect the community and embody the spirit of Luther College. The chosen Fighting Gnome will be a fierce face from our heritage that will represent us for years to come," </quote>  said Thompson.

The Fighting Gnome logo is available for use by designated groups on campus, and will be available to the public when pigs fly.

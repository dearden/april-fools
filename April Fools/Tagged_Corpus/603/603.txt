Tiger haters, beware.

A virtual army of private bodyguards - about 90 in all - will be protecting Tiger Woods when he returns to golf this week at the Masters, London's Sunday Mail reported Saturday.

Woods' vast security detail will include former FBI and Secret Service agents, as well as armed deputies - all of whom are believed to have received photos of the golf great's sexual conquests.

The world's best-known philanderer reportedly fears a confrontation with one of his more than two dozen alleged mistresses.

Roughly 200 security personnel are typically on hand at the annual tournament in Augusta, Ga. With Woods' return, an additional 82 private guards will be patrolling the course's immaculate lawns, sources told the Sunday Mail.

Tiger Woods is reportedly concerned about running into one of his many mistresses at his Masters return.

Whether porn star Joslyn James, the most vocal of Woods' mistresses, or any of the others will even venture to the Masters remains an open question.

Woods' security detail is reportedly provided by the same California firm that supplies guards for his wife, Elin, 30.

The tournament will mark the first time Woods plays professional golf since the Thanksgiving car wreck that led to his unmasking as a serial cheater.

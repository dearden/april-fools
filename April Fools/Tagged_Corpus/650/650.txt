Tavis chose the hairstyle himself A three-year-old boy has been banned from his Tyneside nursery school class for his trendy  <quote> "tramlines" </quote>  haircut. The mother of Tavis Cook was told the youngster's distinctive hairdo broke the rules of Riverside primary School in North Shields. Donna Cook has been told to keep her son away until his hair grows back. North Tyneside Council said it was aware of the matter and was advising Ms Cook on her options. No-one at the school was available for comment. Miss Cook took the youngster to the barber's where he chose the trendy hairstyle. He is the most placid, lovely lad, he's never in trouble

Donna Cook But less than an hour after dropping the youngster off for nursery class the next morning, she was telephoned and asked to return to collect him. Miss Cook, 21, a mother of two, of Cardonnel Street, North Shields, said:  <quote> "The wall of the barber's shop was covered with hundreds of pictures of different haircuts. " </quote> Tavis marched straight up and picked out the one where the man had tramlines.  <quote> "I'd checked with the school and been told there was no uniform policy for either the nursery year or reception year, and I thought the haircut looked good. " </quote> When I arrived he was in floods of tears. I can't believe they'd do this to a little boy like Tavis.  <quote> "He is the most placid, lovely lad, he's never in trouble." </quote>  A spokesman for North Tyneside Council said:  <quote> "We are aware of this issue and are currently advising the parent on the matter." </quote>  A spokesman from Riverside Primary School said head teacher Dame Mary MacDonald was not available for comment.

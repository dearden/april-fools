Asda has admitted drivers paid just 12.9p a litre for petrol after staff put a decimal point in the wrong place.

About 50 motorists stocked up on unleaded fuel at the petrol station in Rooley Lane, Bradford, West Yorkshire, on Wednesday.

Drivers queued up to use the automatic card-payment pumps for about two hours until the mistake was spotted.

Some motorists also filled up petrol cans with the bargain fuel after word spread around the city.

An Asda spokesman said:  <quote> "For a couple of hours some lucky customers got some petrol at the wrong price at our Rooley Lane store." </quote>

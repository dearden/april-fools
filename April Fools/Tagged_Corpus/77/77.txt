Having just returned from the set of SUPERNATURAL, this TV addict was in no mood to going through the massive pile of mail that accumulated while I was away. Luckily, one oddly thick package caught my attention…

Yes my friends, your eyes don’t deceive you. In this TV addict’s possession is the season (possibly series) finale script of the GILMORE GIRLS! Dying to discover what happens to our favourite gals from Stars Hollow? Highlight the inviso-text below to find out. Needless to say, spoiler-phobes beware.

With Rory preparing to graduate from Yale and move to New York for grad school, Lorelai finds herself at a crossroads. Not willing to be left alone in Stars Hollow, Lorelai must finally choose between marrying Luke or returning to Christopher. Of course like everything in Stars Hollow, nothing is as easy as it seems. Marrying Luke means moving to New Mexico to be with April. While committing to Christopher means shutting Luke out of her life forever.

The episode reaches a climax at Rory’s graduation, as the entire town shows up for the big event. As Rory receives her diploma from special guest star Christiane Amanpour, Lorelai looks over at Chris who’s beaming with pride. She realizes that Christopher is indeed her soul mate, and that family is more important than anything else. Lorelai decides to sell her portion of the Dragonfly Inn to Sookie and Michel and move to Paris with Christopher and Gigi. Luke, unable to bare losing Lorelai again, decides to sell the diner to Kirk and moves to New Mexico to be closer to April. Melissa McCarthy, Yanic Truesdale, Liza Weil and Sean Gunn also star.  Stephen Clancy directed the episode written by Rebecca Rand Kirshner (#2T7768).

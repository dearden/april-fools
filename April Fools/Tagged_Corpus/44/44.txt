Well, it had to happen.  The Disney company, that multimedia giant, has ventured into education.   <quote> "It's time to participate more fully in the social-networked era of learning," </quote>  said a spokesman for the company which has produced such educational hits as Dumbo, A Goofy Movie and Recess: All Growed Down, among others.  Citing technology's influence over the changes in education and communication, he added  <quote> "it's a world of wikis, a world of blogs. It's a world of Moodle and Drupal and pods. There's so much out there that Disney's aware, it's a new, new, world." </quote> 

When asked what sort of projects the company had in store, he described three:

--An online crosscurricular poetry -writing platform featuring some of Disney's most lovable icons:

Minnie 'n Mickey's WIkkiWACky HAIKU

--An online site for bookmarking dreams, reveries and hallucinations:

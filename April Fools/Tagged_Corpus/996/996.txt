Two decades after they altered the face of hip-hop music, Queens-based rappers Run-DMC walked their way into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Saturday.

The pioneering rappers from Hollis - Joseph (Run) Simmons, Darryl (DMC) McDaniels and Jason (Jam Master Jay) Mizell - were feted in a raucous celebration of rock in Cleveland before thousands of screaming fans.

Missing, of course, was Mizell, the group's iconic deejay, whose shocking 2002 murder remains unsolved.

Mizell's mother, Connie Mizell, accepted the award on his behalf.

 <quote> "My baby is still doing it for me," </quote>  she said.

Simmons, now a reality TV star, thanked Connie Mizell for letting the group practice in the living room of her Hollis home.

 <quote> "She never told us to turn the music down once," </quote>  Simmons said, turning to his late friend's mom.  <quote> "I'd like to thank you for that." </quote> 

Hugely popular in the 1980s, Run-DMC is credited with breaking rap music into the mainstream and popularizing its fashion.

The rappers' unique fashion style - white Adidas sneakers with no laces, Kangol hats and gold rope chains - spread across the country.

But it was the trio's historic collaboration with Aerosmith on a remake of the rock group's track  <quote> "Walk This Way" </quote>  that turned Run-DMC into household names across the U.S.

 <quote> "They broke away from the pack by beating the pack," </quote>  rap star Eminem said in his induction speech.

 <quote> "They were the baddest of the bad and the coolest of the cool. Run-DMC changed my life. ... There's three of them and if you grew up with hip hop like I did, they were the Beatles." </quote> 

Open to the public for the first time, the high-flying event felt more like a rock concert than an awards ceremony.

Nearly 5,000 fans cheered and danced in the balconies inside the Public Auditorium as 1,200 VIPs dined below at tables costing as much as $50,000 each.

Also inducted in this year's class were hard-rock band Metallica, the 1950s New York vocal group Little Anthony and the Imperials, guitarist Jeff Beck and singer/songwriter Bobby Womack.

Rockabilly legend Wanda Jackson was inducted as an  <quote> "early influence." </quote>  Three artists were inducted in the sideman category: writer/producer Spooner Oldham and two members of Elvis Presley's earliest band, drummer D.J. Fontana and bass player Bill Black.With News Wire Services

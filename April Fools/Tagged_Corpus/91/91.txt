April Fools Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy  <quote> "Jimbo" </quote>  Wales has resigned as Board member and Chair Emeritus of the Wikimedia Foundation, severing his seven-year relationship with  <quote> "the free encyclopedia anyone can edit." </quote> 

The man who once called himself Wikipedia's Spiritual Leader has also stepped down as the president of Wikia, the for-profit operation he co-founded in 2004.

In a candid interview with The Register, Wales said he intends to join the brotherhood of Franciscan Friars, taking the traditional vows of poverty, celibacy, and obedience.  <quote> "This is the life I was born to live," </quote>  he said.  <quote> "There are more important things than power, fame, venture capital, $95,000 speaking fees, and having sex with the Canadian Ann Coulter. Which I did, by the way." </quote> 

In joining the Franciscans, Wales has his sights set on a new breed of encyclopedia.  <quote> "With the help of renunciates from across the globe, I plan to record the sum of all human knowledge on stone tablets," </quote>  he told us.  <quote> "I'm not interested in the Web 2.0 hype machine. I'm not interested in Google rankings, CNet coverage, or hobnobbing with Bono on the rooftop of some five-star Mexican hotel. Which I did, by the way. I'm interested in the pursuit of knowledge. This is the sole motivation behind Stonetabletopedia." </quote> 

Like Wikipedia, Stonetabletopedia will rely on  <quote> "the wisdom of the masses." </quote>  Any monk will have the power to edit any stone tablet.  <quote> "If one man of God completes an entry on, say, Hello Kitty, the next is free to re-chisel. Throw enough monks and enough stone tablets at Hello Kitty, and you can't help but reach the truth." </quote> 

Is Wales worried these stonetablet-fiddlers might hijack his encyclopedia for PR purposes? Push their own point of view when editing entires on, say, the Catholic Church? St. Francis? Bald spots?  <quote> "Absolutely not," </quote>  Wales said.  <quote> "After all, these are men of God. And everyone knows you can trust a man of God. In fact, you can trust them every bit as much as you trust me." </quote> 

Wales puts so much trust in his renunciates, he's given them the unalienable right to chisel anonymously.  <quote> "At Stonetabletopedia," </quote>  he said,  <quote> "we assume good faith." </quote> 

But some have questioned the wisdom of anonymous chiseling. According to The Stonetabletopedia Review, a new site dedicated to stone tablet criticism, a monk somewhere in Alberta, Canada is already chiseling under the pseudonym FatWhore, and many suspect he's a British spy sent by Her Majesty's government to discredit Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne.

When we phoned Byrne, he declined to comment.

 <quote> "FatWhore is not a problem," </quote>  Wales said.  <quote> "He's a monk's monk." </quote>  The fifth columnists will come, he explained, but they'll come from The Stonetabletopedia Review.  <quote> "We assume good faith - but only until we decide not to. There's no doubt these people are intent on destroying the encyclopedia from within.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "Luckily, I know a fake Franciscan when I see one. And when these charlatans are caught, we'll give their tablets the Charlton Heston treatment. We'll boot them from the brotherhood. We'll excommunicate them. We may even kill them." </quote> 

Wales is equally adamant that his new encyclopedia is not a commercial venture. The idea isn't to make money, he said, the idea is to enlighten.  <quote> "Remember: The Catholic Church is a not-for-profit. There's no money in the Catholic Church." </quote> 

Yes, he recently incorporated a for-profit operation that deals in stone tablets. But he claims the two ventures are unrelated. And he insists the for-profit operation has nothing to do with profit.  <quote> "Stonetabletopedia and Stonetablet-o-pedia are completely separate operations," </quote>  he explained.  <quote> "And I'm about to take a vow of poverty. Which means that even if I pocket millions of dollars, I can always claim it's not mine." </quote> 

Jimmy Wales also wants the world to know that Stonetabletopedia has absolutely nothing to do with Larry Sanger.  <quote> "That's true," </quote>  Sanger told us,  <quote> "except that it was my idea." </quote>

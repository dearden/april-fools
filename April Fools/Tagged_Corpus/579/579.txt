Sir John Evans said he accepted his responsibility for the offence

Sir John Evans was caught speeding near his old police headquarters at Exeter in Devon.

Sir John, 60, pleaded guilty at Exeter Magistrates' Court and was fined £500, ordered to pay £35 costs and given six penalty points.

He now has nine points on his licence and will face an automatic ban if he speeds again in the next three years.

Previous endorsements

The retired former chief constable was photographed by a speed camera on the A30 at Sowton on his way to a charity event last November.

Magistrates said they had given Sir John, former head of the Association of Chief Police Officers and now working for the FA as a security adviser, credit for his guilty plea.

The court heard Sir John, who has a £40,000 per year police pension, has two previous endorsements on his driving licence.

In July 2000, his licence was endorsed when he failed to comply with traffic lights and in January this year he was given a fixed penalty fine and three points for another speeding case.

Sir John admitted the charge by letter and said he accepted his responsibility in this matter.

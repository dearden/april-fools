LOS ANGELES — A casting company is currently looking for the Snookie of Yelp! An unnamed national cable network is in talks to launch its most audacious foray into reality-TV programming yet: Yelping Across Amerika, an hour-long show set to chronicle the misadventures of a rag-tag group of urban foodies as they  <quote> "yelp" </quote>  across the country in a tricked-out Yelp RV.

something funny Auditions for the show have already begun in some test markets including Tallahassee, FL and Jackson, WY, and initial buzz seems to indicate the series just may have a built-in audience.

 <quote> "Are you kidding? A chance to rack up FTRs in Baton Rouge or North Dakota? My DYL buds back in Chicago will never know what the FUC happened," </quote>  chimed Helena H., in a vernacular indicative of the insider-like mannerisms of what has been dubbed the  <quote> "Yelp Elite Squad." </quote> 

 <quote> "Characters are indeed welcome," </quote>  said Geoff Donaker, Chief Operating Officer at Yelp.  <quote> "If you're authentically irreverent, what the kids call 'crazysexycool', then this show promises to be a 5-star experience." </quote> 

Ruggy  <quote> "Rigby" </quote>  Joesten, Yelp's Community Manager in San Francisco, hinted that the RV itself will be central to the premise:  <quote> "Picture the ragged glory of the General Lee, combined with the ramshackle enigma of the Mystery Machine, and you'll get a sense of what's in store... you'll be shocked at some of the reviews you'll hear from the 'confessional glove compartment'." </quote> 

Yelping Across Amerika does have some critics, however, which is nothing new for the online city guide.  <quote> "What's next? Parties with free booze, burlesque dancers, and mini ponies? I think Yelp needs to find what it's looking for and accelerate into the curve," </quote>  commented Chad Ungerer, Co-Chairman of the Council on Fair User Generated Content.

But Nish Nadaraja, Yelp's BMF, believes in the vision:  <quote> "Imagine Yelp reviews but with the added dimension of real life behind closed doors – just a little claustrophobic and carsick, in desperate need of a shower, still horny as hell — to capture that sort of reality-based entertainment; sometimes you have to break a few eggs to make an omelet." </quote> 

 <quote> "Would I get in the RV with them?" </quote>  mused Jeremy Stoppelman, Chief Executive Officer at Yelp.  <quote> "Probably not, but I wish them the best of luck, whoever they'll be. I'm very sensitive to smells and pollen; I don't travel well." </quote> 

To make this first season an unforgettable one, the casting company is looking for outgoing men and women between 23-40 years of age that fit the following identities:

Pretentious Gourmand
DFW (Down For Whatever)
Yelp Serial Dater
The Virgin
The Exasperated Elite
Yelper With Privileges

Actress and former  <quote> "Charlie's Angel" </quote>  Farrah Fawcett has reportedly been in the hospital since Thursday.

The 62-year-old sex symbol has been battling cancer for the last three years. Although she went into remission, it returned in the spring of 2007.



A jubilant Fawcett erroneously announced in early 2007 that she was cancer free.



 <quote> "In the face of excruciating pain and uncertainly, I never lost hope and it never occurred to me to stop fighting â€“ not ever," </quote>  she said in a statement to fans.



Fawcett told  <quote> "Extra" </quote>  after her last hospital stint that she  <quote> "never can say for sure" </quote>  how she is doing in her cancer battle, adding  <quote> "it's ongoing." </quote> 



The actress previously sought alternative medicine treatments in Germany, which she later said were  <quote> "tiring." </quote> 



People.com confirmed Fawcett had been hospitalized. Earlier in the evening, Radaronline.com first indicated she was unconscious and long-time boyfriend Ryan O'Neal was with her.

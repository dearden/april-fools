Sending out an alert to our beloved Glamberts, this is an update of utmost importance!

A source close to the fabulous sexiness that is Adam Lambert has revealed exclusive information to us regarding his upcoming third studio album!

Lately the superstar has been pretty busy with his television work, from mentoring on American Idol to appearing on Glee, but it seems that the former Idol runner-up is back in the studio and recording again with pop super-producer Max Martin, and a handful of ace songwriters, in Sweden.

Our source, who prefers to remain anonymous, has sent over an image that shows lyrics for a new song. The song is said to be very personal, with underlying messages in the lyrics! Seems like Adam has been taking songwriting lessons from Ms. Taylor Swift.

We wonder who or what the song is about and when (if ever) it will be released, but we are very sure Glamberts are absolutely thrilled for this piece of news!

To celebrate the start of this new era, we are giving away a set of autographed Adam Lambert albums (Trespassing and For Your Entertainment) to one lucky Glambert!

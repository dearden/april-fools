Hot on the heels of this week's announcement of Battlefield 1942, Aspyr Media revealed today that they will be developing and publishing a brand new Sims expansion for both Mac and PC. The farm-related expansion, titled The Sims: Milkin' It!, adds hundreds of new objects and activities to The Sims and is scheduled to hit the shelves this summer.

Here's more from the press release:

 <quote> "Frankly, we were disappointed when Electronic Arts announced that Makin' Magic would be the final Sims expansion for PC. We saw no reason to cut short the all-time best-selling series of computer games," </quote>  said Glenda Adams, Director of PC & Mac Development at Aspyr.  <quote> "That's when we began talking to Electronic Arts about acquiring the rights. And with The Sims 2 delayed until fall, our timing couldn't have been better." </quote> 

Milkin' It!, which will feature the same graphical interface and isometric view the series is known for, adds a new  <quote> "Farming Zone." </quote>  For the first time ever, players can take their Sims back to basics, far from the suburbia theme the series is well known for.  <quote> "I'm a small town cowgirl at heart myself, so I couldn't be happier with the new direction the series is taking," </quote>  said Glenda.

Players can manage a multitude of different farms such as Amish, organic, and even a large-scale  <quote> "agri-business" </quote>  complete with slaughterhouse and meat-rendering plant. Hundreds of unique chores await eager players, including harvesting crops, milking cows, slaughtering chickens and collecting their eggs. At the end of the year, take your pumpkins and pigs to compete in the Country Fair and maybe your Sims will take home a blue ribbon!

 <quote> "Our expansion is true to the Sims legacy," </quote>  Glenda Adams explained.  <quote> "Your sims' farm is only as strong as the relationships between the various sims: the farmer, his wife, migrant workers, even the stableboy and the farmer's daughter. Manage the relationships well, and your farm will prosper-- God willin' and the creek don't rise!" </quote> 

Aspyr has not ruled out future expansions if this one sells well.  <quote> "Now that the Sims are no longer trapped in suburbia there are endless possibilities," </quote>  Glenda explained to IMG in an exclusive interview this morning.  <quote> "Like a 'Sims: Survivor' reality show. Or maybe we'll try to interest hardcore gamers with a World War II expansion, or explore the criminal element with 'The Sims: Underground.' Farms are just the beginning." </quote>

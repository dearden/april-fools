Traxxas dropped a bomb on the RC hobby community today with the unveiling of the soon to be released Traxxas T-Maxx 4S 4-Stroke monster truck! While the details are still a bit fuzzy, what we do know is that the T-Maxx 4S 4-Stroke will be powered by a newly developed O.S. FS-58 four stroke nitro powerplant that is said to put out nearly three times the torque and twice the horsepower of the T-Maxx 3.3 2-stroke engine! To handle the additional power, the T-Maxx 4S will feature an extra thick 6mm chassis, all steel driveline components, quad-disc brakes and super heavy duty differentials. It is expected to hit hobby shop shelves late next month for about $650. Stay tuned!

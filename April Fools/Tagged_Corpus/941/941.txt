STUNNING Ferena Wazeir is the Scot taking Bollywood by storm

The 24-year-old singer-turned-actress has so many fans that she needs round the clock security to stop her being mobbed on set.

Ferena, who is Bollywood's answer to Angelina Jolie and Cameron Diaz, insists she could never have dreamed of becoming the sweetheart of the Asian silver screen.

She said:  <quote> "I'm still taking it all in as it has happened so fast. One minute I was living in Glasgow and the next I was working alongside some of the biggest names in Bollywood.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "I know Hollywood stars get mobbed by fans and followed by the paparazzi but for the stars of Indian cinema it's even crazier as our movies are seen by millions of people across the world.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "On a few occasions I've got a bit scared by the fans and I have security on set. When I'm finishing my final scenes we have to pretend there are still more to come so I don't get trampled on. It's just mad. There are hundreds of people screaming my name." </quote> 

Ferena, who attended Glasgow's Laurel Park School, plays the lead in Sadiyaan, which premiered in Mumbai on Friday and also stars Rishi Kapoor and Luv Sinha.

The movie, now being shown at selected cinemas across the UK, is the part-time model's second. Her first, Rang Rasia, is out in Europe in May.

Ferena admits she never set out to become a Bollywood star and as a child she dreamed of being a politician or a journalist.

The star, whose family hail from Kashmir, said:  <quote> "I worked really hard at school and always thought I would end up in academia like the rest of my family. It was only when I went to India a few years ago that I took up Indian dancing and singing lessons." </quote> 

The beauty, who was discovered at a camel fair, thought the photographer who approached her was having a laugh.

But soon after she was doing shoots for Elle magazine and was chosen as the face of Indian jewellery giant P.C. Chandra.

Ferena, who trained at RADA in London, said:  <quote> "I was just walking about looking at camels when a guy asked if he could take my picture.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "After that there was no looking back. I did shoots for clothing brands and magazines and ended up on a 20ft billboard as the face of India's biggest jeweller. It was crazy.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "Then I was invited to audition for theatre and film roles and I haven't looked back since. I can't quite believe I'm working alongside stars like Rishi Kapoor and Hema Malini who I idolised as a child. It's a dream come true." </quote> 

The sultry beauty admits her dad was not impressed that she chose movies over politics - until first minister Alex Salmond admitted he was a big fan.

Ferena said:  <quote> "My dad gave us all the best education he could so it came as a shock to him when I chose Bollywood over politics. I think he would have liked me to become the next female prime minister not the next Jodie Foster.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "He changed his tune when we met Alex Salmond at a wedding and he told my dad he was a massive fan of Asian film and knew who I was.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "It's only since then that my family have realised what a really big business Bollywood is.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "In a way it's my dad's fault I went down the acting route as the pair of us used to sit up into the wee small hours watching Indian movies." </quote> 

Ferena, who splits her time between Glasgow, Mumbai and London, reveals the acting lifestyle is not as glamorous as it looks. She said:  <quote> "When I'm filming I can be on set from 3.30am to midnight without much of a break and the dance numbers leave you exhausted.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "I regularly end up in tears at the end of the day as all my limbs are numb and there is blood running down my arms and legs from the heavy bangles on my ankles and wrists.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "You end up covered in bruises. I have the utmost respect for actors and actresses who have been dancing for years. It's no easy feat." </quote> 

Ferena, who loves coming home to shop in Buchanan Street and Princes Square, insists she is going to make it her life's ambition to bring more Bollywood movies to Scotland.

She said:  <quote> "I know Scottish Screen want to make more Indian movies in Scotland and I would like to become an ambassador for them.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "Scotland really has some amazing backdrops and just imagine the tourism that a Bollywood film would generate. Thousands flocked here after watching Kuch Kuch Hota Hai." </quote> 

And the star, who does kung fu in her spare time, says that no matter how big she becomes in India, she will always consider herself a Scot.

She said:  <quote> "They have made me tone down my Scots accent for the movies but the minute I speak to my friends and family it comes flooding back.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "Scotland is a great country and I will continue to make it proud." </quote>

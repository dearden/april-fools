This year’s Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000 will see V8 Supercars introduce a ‘fan boost’ feature, giving chosen drivers a temporary horsepower increase.

The V8 Boost system will allow fans to vote via social media for their favourite driver, with the most popular receiving an extra shot of 41bhp for a maximum of 60 seconds.

The system is similar to that run in the inaugural FIA Formula E Championship.

In a V8 Supercars twist, Australian fans will also be able to vote on which driver they want to see endure a similarly structured power reduction, known as V8 Reduce.

Viewers will be able to see when the boost is engaged with high intensity LED lights flashing green when the team chooses to benefit from the extra horsepower.

A red LED light will similarly be activated when the team chooses to take their horsepower penalty.

Team pit booms and engineering stations will also be connected to the lights system.

The V8 Supercars television coverage will carry live updates until voting closes and alerts when V8 Boost and V8 Reduce are engaged.

Although yet to be confirmed, the voting system and allocation of V8 Boost and Reduce is expected to be repeated every hour during the 161 lap race.

According to Bottle-O Racing driver, David Reynolds, the initiative is bound to cause controversy.

His Prodrive Racing Australia team has been proactive in developing the system since it was first mooted at February’s Sydney Test.

The system, dubbed the AF-01-04, is expected to be track tested for the first time later this month.

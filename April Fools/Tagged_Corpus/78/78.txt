Redmond, WA: At an unusual press conference held this Sunday morning, Bill Taylor, Microsoft's General Manager of Platform Strategy, announced that after much research into the causes of security holes and instabilities, Microsoft will eliminate mutable variables from the .NET platform and its languages, including C# and VB.NET.  <quote> "One of our top researchers found that mutable variables were the major root cause preventing us from achieving the great user experience we always strive to deliver," </quote>  said Taylor.  <quote> "Once we realized that, eliminating them from .NET was a no-brainer." </quote> 

Given that this announcement was made on a Sunday, reactions have been limited so far, but one prominent VB.NET developer commented that  <quote> "Compared to the switch from VB6 to VB.NET, this ought to be a breeze." </quote>  A C# developer was heard to say,  <quote> "After anonymous delegates, monads shouldn't be a problem." </quote> 

To ensure wide penetration of this significant update, Microsoft will be issuing updated Windows CDs to all licensed customers, free of charge. The new CDs can be identified by the distinctive holographic  <quote> "Haskell Inside" </quote>  logo, featuring a holographic version of this portrait of Simon Peyton-Jones, grinning from ear to ear.

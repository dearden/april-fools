BOSTON - US scientists are frantically working on contingency plans after a study revealed the world wide web would become saturated with content by the year 2012.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) report found that at the current rate of uploading, all the world's servers and all those projected to be built would be full inside the next three years.

Computer scientists are divided on whether to try and somehow increase the capacity of the web or to start deleting pages no longer deemed essential.

Blogs analysing the minutiae of daily life, Facebook profiles for animals and the 1,980,000 pages devoted to David Hasselhoff are some of those nominated by scientists as candidates to be axed.

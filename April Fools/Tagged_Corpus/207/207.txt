Civilization V is coming later this year, and with it, a few improvements to please the masses: better graphics, a new hexagonal tile system. Now comes word of a new mode,  <quote> “Extreme Diplomacy” </quote> . And if you think that means your world leaders will have the option to be really, really nice to each other, you’re wrong! Nope, Civilization V is getting all hardcore on us. Extreme Diplomacy mode brings hand to hand combat into the mix. When military force and normal diplomacy fail, players will now have the option to send the two world leaders into the ring. Two enter, only one leaves.

Additionally, a deluxe edition of Civilization V will have special attacks and finishing moves for the new mode, including George Washington’s Wooden Tooth Chomp Attack, Cleopatra’s Phalanx of the Leopard Army, Genghis Khan’s Arrow Shower from the Mongol Bow, and more. The deluxe edition will also come with an eight button arcade style joystick for use with the game, for a  <quote> “classic fighting arcade game feel” </quote>  during Extreme Diplomacy battles.

IT sounds like a fisherman's tale - but keen angler Frank Warwick really has landed in a record-breaking catch.



TV pundit Frank caught a 9ft catfish in the Ebro river during a holiday in Barcelona.



Weighing in at 203lbs, it is one pound bigger than the highest recorded with the international fishing association IGFA.



Frank, from Styal, Cheshire, admits that pulling in the catch was quite a task.



He said:  <quote> "It nearly pulled me in with it. Two of the guides who were with me had to grab me round the waist. It is like being pulled by a bus - it's an unbelievable force.

 <quote> "It took three quarters of an hour to reel it in and it really does feel like you are fighting with something the whole time." </quote> 

Dinghy



Father-of-three Frank is already well known within the angling community as a regular contributor to programmes such as Tight Lines and Total Fishing.



A life-long fisherman, he took up the sport by going angling with his dad aged six and has spent 37 years chasing carp.



He decided to try his hand at the famous Spanish catfish at the last minute when plans to travel to Morocco fell through.



Frank took a leaky dinghy out into the strong current of the river to sink the lead weights and fixed up his rod with a single large hook to land his catch.

Red Sox Internet Ace Will Bring His
Long-Winded Analysis to a Japanese Audience *

He's Got a New Changeup, Why Not a New Language, Too?

Boston Dirt Dogs has learned today -- April 1 -- that Red Sox web guru Curt Schilling will launch a new Japanese-language blog next week that will feature his analysis of Daisuke Matsuzaka's starts this season.

Similar to what Schilling does now on his English-language blog, 38Pitches.com, he will offer between 10,000-15,000 words of analysis of each pitch Matsuzaka throws during his starts. Schilling's plan is to have the recap posted live by the time Matsuzaka begins his postgame press conferences. Schilling will also invite site visitors to leave comments on his entries, ask him questions, post any random thought that comes to mind, post links to their MySpace pages, ask him for money, or request a personal meeting the next time he is in Japan ... similar to the reader postings on 38Pitches.com now.

Schilling's mastery of Japanese accelerated this spring between postings on 38Pitches.com, to the point that he feels he's fluent enough to launch this new site.

BDD was able to obtain a draft of Schilling's initial blog entry which included the following passage:
Schilling's first blog entry in Japanese
Translated back to English, the above reads  <quote> "I have decided to name my new Japanese blog Dice-a Roni." </quote>  The name plays homage to Schilling's appearance on Celebrity Jeopardy this past offseason when he froze after responding to  <quote> "the answer is" </quote>  and could not identify  <quote> "The San Francisco Treat" </quote>  as  <quote> "Rice-A-Roni." </quote>  Schilling also advises his new audience that if they are not interested in what he has to say about Matsuzaka's outings  <quote> "you don't have to click over here, simple as that." </quote> 

Schilling also plans to break a little news to his new audience again. In his is opening entry on the new blog, he is expected to detail secret talks between Larry Lucchino's Japanese entourage and Seattle Mariners outfielder Ichiro Suzuki, who will be a free agent at the end of the season.

In addition, Schilling hand picked Dr. Bill Morgan to develop a wrist, hand, and finger plan that should enable Schilling to handle the load of typing up to 30,000 words per week on both blogs this season.

The  <quote> "Pix'n'Mix Reg" </quote>  is the result of 18 months' reader surveying and back-room coding during which we identified the things which really bug you about the world's biggest IT news site - and those things you just couldn't do without.

So, if you can't stand a particular author's musings on, say, Web 2.0, UK ID Cards, or black helicopter conspiracy theories, no problem: just one click of the mouse button and he's gone from your Pix'n'Mix Reg - forever.

Everyone seems to be getting in on the mini action these days… Brandt Peters & Kathie Olivas's Mini Skelve, Ashley Wood's Mini Berties, MAD's Mini MAD*L, and — now — Andrew Bell's Mini Giant Zlik. Our source, Bell's trusted dog walker, was quoted on the matter thusly:

Mister Bell, he ask me:  <quote> "You walk dog now" </quote>  and I say  <quote> "Yes." </quote>  Then Mister Bell lean in close — very close, too close — and whisper:  <quote> "My 'Mini Giant Zliks' are coming." </quote> 

Wow… powerful, moving stuff. But why is this 3" incarnation of Bell's platform being called the <quote> "Mini Giant Zlik" </quote> ? Well, as you can see above, this version shares it's form with the 19" Giant Zlik as opposed to having the base of the normal 6" Zlik. There is no official release date or price point yet, but we highly doubt such things will be made known until after this release has already dropped and sold out!

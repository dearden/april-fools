The fifth Die Hard film being directed by Irishman John Moore, Live Free of Die Hard, has just added its two main villains; Sebastian Koch (who folk will remember from The Lives of Others) and newcomer Yulia Snigir have just signed up, reports Variety.

This time out, John McClane and his son head to Russia to save the world. The casting of his offspring took months, until Moore, Willis and the studio finally settled on Australian actor Jai Courtney. Skip Woods, who has penned the likes of Wolverine, The A-Team and Hitman, bashed out the screenplay for this one.

It's a shame the most influential, and one of the best, action movies of all time is still be cannibalised. I didn't hate Die hard 4.0 at all; I thought Len Wiseman did a very slick job. But, it's a not Die Hard film, and this doesn't sound like it will be either.

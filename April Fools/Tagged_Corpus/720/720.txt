The new  <quote> "Energy and Ingenuity" </quote>  exhibit at Discovery World plays with power in every way you can imagine, from renewable resources like solar and wind all the way to the kinetics of people power.

 <quote> "We are showing the entire portfolio on creating energy and showing all kinds of examples of recycling and green living," </quote>  said Joel Brennan, Discovery World's CEO.  <quote> "It's become one of the most popular venues." </quote> 

The centerpiece of the exhibit is a colossal model of a Westinghouse nuclear reactor that visitors get to play with to manipulate the power of a virtual city. A bunch of buttons controls the ebb and flow of energy to an imaginary metropolis that's going to go dark if you don't take action.

It's all quite theatrical, with a dramatic voice ordering out the proper operating procedures.

Press the proper flashing button when prompted, and the mechanical reactor springs to life as fake control rods rise. The reactor also shows how the heat from the nuclear reaction with the rods generates steam, turning the turbine and powering the generator.

An electronic display on the control panel shows the ratios of imaginary stream pressure and how much energy is being produced. Meanwhile, a flat-screen television a few feet away shows a cityscape lighting to life thanks to your efforts.

 <quote> "It takes you through both physically and visually to simulate the experience," </quote>  Brennan said.

A second, smaller model shows the automatic shutdown mechanics for a reactor in case of emergencies. A push of a button sends the control rods crashing down into its fuel mix, neutralizing the reaction, according to Carl Schoettel, Discovery World's chief operating officer.

 <quote> "All modern reactors work this way," </quote>  Schoettel says.  <quote> "This system is very safe." </quote> 

Brennan said the museum will continue to include more information on nuclear energy safety and waste management as the exhibit grows, noting that it's important that visitors get a complete picture behind the power.

The exhibit, which is sponsored by the Wisconsin Energy Foundation, has been open for about a month in its most finished form, although it's been officially open to the public since Thanksgiving.

 <quote> "The goal here is to take the mystery out of nuclear energy," </quote>  Brennan said.  <quote> "There is also a show business aspect to the experience, and the young people linger here because of it." </quote> 

The massive model reactor might be the star of the show, but there are plenty of supporting players, starting with the warm-up acts of the three different types of photovoltaic panels on the roof of Discovery World and wind turbines on the front lawn. Another wind turbine inside the building is synched with the wind-blown ones outside using software to add some inside-outside continuity.

And there are many other examples of energy, including something as basic as a teapot-power steam turbine that lights up some energy-efficient light emitting diodes.

 <quote> "This is where it all starts at a basic introductory level," </quote>  Schoettel said.

There is an interesting but disconcerting display that uses a Geiger counter and items on a lazy Susan to show the varying levels of radioactivity in different objects, ranging from raw uranium to a china plate.

A tank with electric eels powers lights and speakers indicating their discharges.

A Van de Graaff generator teaches visitors about static electricity.

And the museum has built a small  <quote> "energy opportunity" </quote>  home as part of the exhibit, with dozens of examples of energy-saving technologies, including different types of insulation, light bulbs, flooring, brick facing and other building materials. A monstrous wall of coal - covered in a clear epoxy for safety - towers over all.

But the attraction drawing one of the longest lines last week was a human hamster wheel that visitors can climb into and run forward to fuel some lights overhead. People start off running with no resistance and then the link to the generator kicks in, making it much slower going.

 <quote> "It helps kids understand it takes a lot of work to create energy," </quote>  Schoettel said.

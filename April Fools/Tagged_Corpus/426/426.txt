The boys (?) of BTS have turned into 'Bangtan Girls'!


For April Fool's Day, the boys' official fancafe changed up their layout to feature the 7 boys in their various drag that they'd gone through in their earlier reality shows, such as maid-Suga, ladybug fairy V, and Sailor Rap Monster. The boy's usual black-and-red page had been turned to a white-and-red page filled with hearts.

Of course, it wouldn't be BTS with extra silliness! Jin got to the boys' official Twitter first, changing the display photo to Mario and the name to 'Super Mario', one of his obsessions, and tweeting,  <quote> "Three mushrooms. Give them now." </quote> 


He apparently wasn't satisfied with that, and he went on to change the photo again and the display name to 'Kim Jin', tweeting,  <quote> "Hello, it's the webtoon artist Kim Jin. I like Jin from BTS. Because we have the same name ^^." </quote> 


Rap Monster joined in with a tweet of his own, writing,  <quote> "I was eating tteokbokki and got my tongue cut off, so I won't be able to rap anymore. I'm writing a bland apology. - Rap Monster." </quote>  He must have realized that no one was going to actually fall for his joke, and quickly wrote,  <quote> "Ah, but the tteokbokki was spicy," </quote>  and then again,  <quote> "To be honest, I did that because I felt like I should do at least something (confession).. Have a beautiful night.." </quote>

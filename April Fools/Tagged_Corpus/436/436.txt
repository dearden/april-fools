The International Equation Naming Organization (IENO) has renamed the Navier-Stokes equations to the Euler-Navier-Cauchy-Poisson-Saint-Venant-Stokes equations or ENComPaSS for short. You will no doubt recall that the ENComPaSS equations are the foundation on which much of modern day fluid dynamics is based, including Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), so this is indeed a momentous event.

We at Symscape made a proposal to rename the Navier-Stokes equations back in October 2014 and at the same time submitted our proposal to IENO. Much to our surprise IENO today released the following statement:

 <quote> "After a careful and thorough examination of the original proposal submitted to IENO for the renaming of the Navier-Stokes equations, we have concluded that a more inclusive naming of said equations is in order. Henceforth the equations previously known as the Navier-Stokes equations will be referred to as the Euler-Navier-Cauchy-Poisson-Saint-Venant-Stokes equations. This name change better represents the origins and development of the equations." </quote>

Notice that the IENO retained the name ordering we proposed, which reflects the chronological contribution of each researcher. Also in further correspondence with IENO we convinced them to retained the short form ENComPaSS, though they felt it sounded a little gimmicky.

Claude-Louis Navier and George Gabriel Stokes were unavailable for comment.

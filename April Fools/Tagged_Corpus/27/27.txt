Aerostich and World Banana have joined forces to market a new brighter Hi-Viz colored banana. Aerostich, a leader in exposing people to the retina searing Hi-Viz yellow color, and World Banana, a fruit grower with operations in Belize and Honduras, will begin introducing the new Hi-Viz bananas to consumers immediately.

 <quote> "As a motorcycle rider I found my Aerostich Hi-Viz suit to be a real advantage in traffic. I wondered if the color would have the same impact on consumers 'driving' their shopping carts in supermarket aisles." </quote>  Said Waldo Shwartz, president of GrinGo‘s Inc., the owner of World Banana.  <quote> "I sent my entire banana engineering team to Aerostich to learn more about Hi-Viz, and they sure did. Bananawise, this is a radical step forward. Selling fruit will never be the same." </quote> 

Currently in final testing, the Hi-Viz bananas are outselling regular banana‘s by more than 3 to 1.  <quote> “This new brighter banana really pokes shoppers in the eye” </quote>  according to Andy Goldfine, design leader at Aerostich.  <quote> “The process of making them a glowing Hi-Viz yellow is a World Banana secret, but it doesn‘t harm the fruit inside. They really light up a produce department, and they taste exactly the same as regular bananas. They have all the same nutritional benefits, too.” </quote>

Shawartz‘s bananas compete directly against bananas from much larger companies.  <quote> “Our new banana will stand out. Kid‘s already love ‘em.” </quote>  Distribution is expected to be nationwide by mid-summer. Aerostich Hi-Viz bananas will be priced about the same as conventional bananas.

Same nutritional value as a regular banana.

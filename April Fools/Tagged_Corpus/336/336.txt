After years of speculation and finger-crossing by millions of teen girls (who are probably in their mid-20’s now), the popular boy band *NSync has recently announced that they will embark on a 41-date tour that will take them across North America in 2012. The We’re Too Old Tour will be in support of a surprise digital album,  <quote> “Is This Really Happening?” </quote> , which will be available later today, April 1.

 <quote> “This could be the biggest tour ever,” </quote>  concert insider April Sciocchi said of the band’s first tour since their PopOdyssey Tour in 2002.  <quote> “*NSync is still bigger than any other band out there right now and fans have been waiting for them to return!” </quote> 

The group was formed in 1995 but didn’t hit it big until a few years later when they catapulted to the top of the musical charts with hits like  <quote> “I Want You Back,” </quote>   <quote> “Tearin’ Up My Heart” </quote>  and  <quote> “I Drive Myself Crazy.” </quote>  The group will be releasing its newest single  <quote> “You Wish” </quote>  later this month.

It has been announced that they will open the tour at Springfield Stadium, home of baseball’s Springfield Isotopes, on June 31.

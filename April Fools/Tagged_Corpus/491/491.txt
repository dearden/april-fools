It is now official. Joel and Ellie are headed to the Xbox One for the sequel to the blockbuster title, The Last Of Us. The Last Of Us Part 2 Xbox One Edition is now officially a thing and will be released on PlayStation 4, and in addition will be available on Xbox One. Phil Spencer, the head of Xbox confirmed today that The Last Of Us Part 2 will be coming with the following quote:

 <quote> “After talking things over with Naughty Dog, it was unanimous that The Last Of Us Part 2 needed to be a part of the Xbox franchise. We are incredibly excited to bring this highly anticipated title to the Xbox One, and we know that our fans will be excited as well. We cannot wait for you to get your hands on this game as we’re so excited, that it doesn’t even seem real to us.” </quote>  – Phil Spencer

There currently is not a release date set for The Last Of Us Part 2 but make no mistake about it, with development alongside Naughty Dog, the chances that we will see the game release sooner rather than later is absolutely a strong possibility. The Last Of Us Part 2 Xbox One Edition is officially a reality and we should find out more information in the coming months, and at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) later this year in June.

 <quote> “We look forward to working with Microsoft now and into the future regarding exciting projects and can’t wait for their fans to enjoy The Last Of Us just as the PlayStation community has.” </quote>  – Neil Druckmann

Tia Carrere thinks it's  <quote> "twisted" </quote>  that she is the happiest she's ever been despite her divorce going public.

The  <quote> "Relic Hunter" </quote>  star filed for divorce from British photojournalist Simon Wakelin Friday, People.com reports.

 <quote> "At  <quote> "the Happiest Place on Earth" </quote>  when the saddest, most personal news about my life pours out on the internet ...Twisted," </quote>  Carrere wrote on Twitter Friday.

The actress, 43, and Wakelin were married for seven years.

Carrere will act as her own attorney as she seeks sole custody of her daughter, Bianca, 4.

The couple's divorce papers cite irreconcilable differences for the split and reveal the duo signed a prenup.

This is Carrere's second marriage. She divorced producer Elie Samaha in 2000.

This news doesn't bode well for eHarmony's press department. It's a PR nightmare when your founder ends up successfully using a competitor. But I do hope that he and Olga are happy. It's always great when you can help someone out overseas and then meet them in person. And Warren helping out Olga financially is like something you'd see right out of Oprah's Big Give. He has a great heart and I wish him and Olga nothing but the best of success in life!!!

SEOUL - U.S., Japan and South Korea deployed warships Friday to monitor a rocket launch by North Korea to test its long-range missile technology.

The planned launch, which could come as early as today, has sparked alarm because North Korea has admitted it has nuclear weapons and has repeatedly broken promises to shelve its nuclear program or halt rocket tests.

President Obama, appearing Friday with French President Nicolas Sarkozy in Strasbourg, France, called the launch  <quote> "provocative" </quote>  and said it should be stopped.

North Korea, which said it is only launching an experimental communications satellite, has complained that the U.S. is using high-altitude U-2 spy planes and has warned the aircraft would be shot down.

Japan has deployed warships and Patriot missile interceptors off its northern coast to shoot down any wayward rocket parts that the North has said might fall over the area.

Tokyo has said it is only protecting its territory and has no intention of trying to shoot down the rocket itself.

But North Korea accused Japan of inciting militarism at home to justify developing a nuclear weapons program of its own.

Pressure on Pyongyang to drop the launch has been intense. The U.S., South Korea and Japan discussed the issue with world leaders at the G-20 summit in London.

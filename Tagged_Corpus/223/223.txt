We've all been there - you've got a great idea for a client and you want to quickly get it down on paper. But what's this? Your sharpie is dull. What client will respect you and your incredible ideas with a dull sharpie?
See what a dull sharpie does? I mean come on, 'buton'?

Introducing Sharpiener

Don't send a client a dull sketch again: instead, send your dull sharpies to ZURB through out new mail-order service, and we'll send back pristine, sharpened sharpies that you can really impress with.
Now there's a sketch that'll get all the ladies.

How do we do it?

At ZURB we're as committed to helping people design as we are to insuring we still have a world to design for, that's why Sharpiener is not only fast but completely green.

While other services might use smoke-belching, electricity-consuming machines to sharpen your sharpies we use completely carbon-neutral interns, with x-acto knives. And don't worry - we also believe in sustainable farming and food consumption, which is why our interns get one organic egg a day.

Once your sharpies have reached our exacting standards of sharposity and awesomeness we mail them back to you; it's that simple.
A simple, sustainable equation.
Well, how do I sign up?

We'll be starting with a select group of dull-sharpie'd designers this week, so head on over to the Sharpiener signup page and get into the private release. Don't worry: as demand increases, we'll simply hire more interns. They're everywhere.

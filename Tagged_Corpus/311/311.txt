Italian-born London-based yachtsman Marco Nannini can confirm today details of a sponsorship deal to support his Global Ocean Race 2011-2012 (GOR) round the world yacht racing campaign from a seemingly unlikely source: businessman and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi who is certainly no stranger to grabbing the media spotlight through his extravagant actions.

 <quote> “My love for the wind and the sea started in my first job as a singer on a cruise ship” </quote>  commented Signor Berlusconi,  <quote> "since those careless and free days I always dreamt to set sail around the world and I am proud today to support a young ambitious Italian sailor to achieve this enviable feat” </quote>  he added.

The Italian skipper will receive a cash injection into his racing funds to rename the boat Bunga Bunga during his round the world race which is due to start in Palma in September this year, in a bid to support Mr Berlusconi's election as president of the supreme court of justice.

 <quote> “Racing around the world on a yacht through the perils of the Southern Ocean's storms is no Bunga Bunga party” </quote>  commented yachtsman Marco Nannini  <quote> and we are delighted to have the opportunity to race a boat with such a light hearted name, it will help us smile through the hardships of the race and we will realise the dream that Mr Berlusconi had as young man” </quote>  he added.

 <quote> “Mr Berlusconi is not just about dinner parties with scantily dressed young girls as the media portrays him today. Mr Berlusconi is first and foremost a philanthropist and a romantic adventurer, he feels that supporting a young Italian such as Marco Nannini in sailing the national flag around the world will be a strong message inviting everyone to look beyond the media headlines” </quote>  commented Aprilio Fullio, Head of External Communications at Fininvest, the holding company of Mr Berlusconi's Media Empire.

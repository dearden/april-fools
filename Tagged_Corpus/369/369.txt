Crooked stones in the notorious Barnhenge roundabout in Barnstaple are to be straightened - with help from dental experts.

The move, revealed this morning, follows complaints that the giant slabs of Delabole slate which form the roundabout's distinctive artwork look like a mouth full of misaligned teeth.

Local orthodontic specialist Paul Oades, of North Devon Orthodontic Centre in Barnstaple, has been tasked with advising engineers on improving the appearance and alignment of the landmark roundabout.

Paul said:  <quote> "The principle of moving and aligning the stones is the same as for moving and aligning a patient's teeth - but with the need for specially-adapted equipment and materials to accommodate the larger size of the stones." </quote> 

The huge slabs of slate were positioned into metal cages on the roundabout in 2006. The stones form the key part of an artwork named Barum Stenning, which was designed by Scottish sculptor Patricia Leighton.

The artwork, at the bottom of Sticklepath Hill, was commissioned by Devon County Council as part of the Western Bypass Project and cost £135,000.

Even before they had been erected they were attracting complaints from people who said they would prefer to have a nice flowerbed instead. And within a few weeks the sculpture had been nicknamed Barnhenge or Moanhenge after a barrage of criticism.

It's not known how much it will cost to align the stones into a less crooked position but the orthodontists hope the work will put a smile on people's face today.

One motorist said:  <quote> "The stones do look like they've been modelled on Pogues singer Shane MacGowan's dental work. Straightening them up will make a big improvement - and maybe a scale and polish too." </quote>

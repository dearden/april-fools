The Star Wars The Last Jedi trailer has finally been revealed ahead of Star Wars Celebration 2017 which is just a few weeks away!

Its finally here! After months of speculation following the 2015 blockbuster Star Wars: The Force Awakens, we have news on the next movie in the Star Wars franchise â€“ Star Wars: The Last Jedi!

The trailer is only a teaser, and is about 43 seconds in length but it contains plenty of hype for the next film in the franchise. In the trailer we can clearly hear voices from both sides of the force calling out to someone who we presume to be The Last Jedi. Voices of Supreme Leader Snoke can be heard along with Jedi Master Yoda, and also Maz Kanata. Poe is also seen flying his X-Wing and Rey and Luke Skywalker are seen as well. The feels are absolutely riveting in the trailer. One notable person missing from the trailer was Finn which leaves us to wonder how critically injured he may have been at the end of The Force Awakens.

As you already know, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is set for release on December 15, 2017. It will to follow the story of Rey as she continues to explore her new powers learning the ways of the force from Luke Skywalker, who had previously been in hiding for years. It is assumed that Luke will train Rey as his apprentice as they prepare to do battle with the leaders of the First Order: Kylo Ren, Supreme Leader Snoke, and General Hux. But enough of me discussing The Last Jedi trailer; take a look at it now! And for more Star Wars news, make sure you keep it locked to Mammoth Gamers!

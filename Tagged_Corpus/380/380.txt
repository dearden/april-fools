THIBODAUX, Louisiana - A Louisiana game warden, John Claude Du Croissant has reported finding a ginormous mosquito in a bayou just outside of the town of Thibodaux.

The town of Thibodaux is noted for having the best crawfish étouffée in the entire state of Louisiana.

Several hunting and fishing sports magazines have referred to Louisiana as The Mosquito Capital of The World.

It is no secret that there are places down in the southern part of Louisiana where skeeters, as Honey Boo Boo calls them, are so big that they have been known to actually attempt to mate with sparrows.

Game Warden Du Croissant stated that the gigantic-enormous mosquito he recently came across down at Bubba Beauregard's Bayou weighed every bit of three pounds.

Du Croissant noted that the mosquito's belly button could have easily held a Planter's peanut.

He pointed out that if that three pounder had bitten an alligator the gator may have fainted from the loss of blood.

SIDENOTE: Warden Du Croissant says that he has the three pound mosquito sitting in a mesh wire cage and he plans to donate it to the San Antonio Zoo.

A year ago, Hewlett Packard Enterprise announced that it would spin off and merge its Enterprise Services Division with CSC to form a new company with expected annual revenues of $26 billion.

That spin-merge, known as a Reverse Morris Trust, has finally been completed, establishing DXC Technology Company.

Close call

 <quote> “With the successful close of our transaction, we are standing up a company that is ideally suited to meeting the needs of a rapidly changing technology marketplace,” </quote>  Mike Lawrie, DXC Technology chairman, president and CEO, said.

 <quote> “We are looking forward delivering on our promise of producing greater value for clients, partners and shareholders, along with growth opportunities for our people.” </quote> 

Lawrie was previously the CEO of CSC, and prior to that he served as the CEO of Misys and Siebel Systems.

To mark its launch, the end-to-end IT services company rang the Opening Bell at the the New York Stock Exchange, as it started trading under the symbol  <quote> “DXC.” </quote> 

DXC does not actually stand for anything.

When the company name was given to employees two months ago, an FAQ said:  <quote> “DXC is not an acronym. The name DXC is a reference to our mission, which is leading clients on their digital transformation journeys. The X is a reference to the company, being a force multiplier, enabling clients to seize the opportunities presented by today's rapidly changing technologies.” </quote> 

The FAQ was outed by TheLayoff.com, an anonymous posting board for victims of job loss.

One alleged employee wrote:  <quote> “I got a bag of DXC swag which included a pen, stickers, and a badge holder. The lobby is decorated with black and white balloons along with DXC banners and videos. I told my customer that today I am now a DXC employee, and had to explain that DXC is not an acronym, which he found confusing.” </quote> *

The site also hosts discussions from DXC employees concerned about potential staff reductions. Rumors are circulating about a Workforce Adjustment Strategy entailing layoffs next month.

*Some online dictionaries, meanwhile, tell us that DXC stands for  <quote> “deathcore (musical style).” </quote>

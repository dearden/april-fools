CSI:NY is testing how far the mighty CSI franchise can be stretched. Michael Idato reports from the show's set.

With the CSI brand behind it you'd think the success of CSI: NY was a safe bet. The show's executive producer isn't so sure.  <quote> "Just because we're under the CSI flagship doesn't mean we have this thing licked," </quote>  says Anthony Zuiker, sitting in the show's Los Angeles production office.  <quote> "We still have to learn through trial and error what works. We're still learning what this show is and what it isn't." </quote> 

CSI: NY, which airs here on Channel Nine, is the third incarnation of the CSI franchise and stars Gary Sinise and Melina Kanakaredes as detectives Mac Taylor and Stella Bonasera. The cast includes Hill Harper (as medical examiner Dr Sheldon Hawkes), Vanessa Ferlito (as Detective Aiden Burn), Carmine Giovinazzo (as Detective Danny Messer) and Eddie Cahill (as Detective Don Flack).  <quote> "Our running motto was we needed to find actors who can pick up a piece of evidence and make it interesting," </quote>  Zuiker says.

As with each version of CSI, procedural police work takes star billing. The characters, however, come a close second, which is a first for the brand.

 <quote> "It is still a forensic procedural drama, but we wanted to give it a different personality," </quote>  Zuiker says.  <quote> "This show is more character driven, it has shorter scripts, it plays with more music, it tells the story more cinematically. That's what we're attempting to do and there are a lot of growing pains at this juncture because it is a brand new show." </quote> 

The emphasis on character undoubtedly played a crucial part in securing the services of Sinise, an Oscar nominee who had never worked in series television. Speaking to The Guide on set during a break in production, Sinise says one of the reasons he signed on was his confidence in Zuiker and his vision for the lead role.  <quote> "We had good meetings, good talks about the character and creatively it sounded like a good thing," </quote>  Sinise says.

As the series unfolds, the back stories of the characters will be developed: Taylor is a former soldier nursing the painful loss of his wife in the World Trade Centre attack, Bonasera is coming to terms with her late father's nefarious business dealings and Hawkes abandoned a surgical career after losing two patients and his confidence.

Sinise's other reason for signing up was the success of the franchise.  <quote> "I knew what I was getting into," </quote>  he says.  <quote> "It was a different city, a different cast and a different set of writers, but I knew we were going to build off something that was already successful." </quote> 

Successful is an understatement. In just five years CSI has become one of the most potent TV brands in the world. At a time of heightened insecurity, where the evening news is filled with dark, violent imagery, viewers are tuning to crime dramas in record numbers.

In that sense, October 1999 saw Zuiker in the right place at the right time. Invited by producer Jonathan Littman to pitch a series to Jerry Bruckheimer, Zuiker suggested a fictional twist on The New Detectives, a forensic documentary series on the Discovery Channel. CSI was born the next year, followed in 2002 by CSI: Miami and, last year, by CSI: NY.

What sets the CSIs apart, Zuiker says, is their visual style, editing, music and pace.  <quote> "We coined the phrase feature television and that is what we're doing. We're making mini-Bruckheimer movies every week," </quote>  he says.

The various versions of CSI take their distinct feel from the cities in which they are set.  <quote> "The city is definitely one of the characters," </quote>  Zuiker says.  <quote> "You go to Las Vegas to escape, to Miami to be seen and to New York to change. All of the cities are characters in their shows." </quote> 

The location also sets the visual style of the shows. CSI: NY initially took its colour cues from the darker end of the spectrum, its blue and black grains distinct from the bright neon and shadows of the original CSI, while Miami is richer in greens, browns and orange.  <quote> "Where CSI is colourful and Miami is alive with hot colours, NY is steely and raw and rough, and its colours are more grainy because of the fabric of the city," </quote>  Zuiker says.

Not everyone has been happy with the choice of palette for the latest instalment.  <quote> "We learned at about eight episodes in that perhaps the show was looking too gloomy," </quote>  Zuiker concedes. According to US media reports, the CBS network ordered someone to turn up the lights.  <quote> "We're still monkeying with the light and finding the right colour palette," </quote>  Zuiker says.

What prompted CBS's concern with the look of the show was its softer-than-expected ratings in the US. Channel Nine, facing the same problem here, is undoubtedly watching the numbers closely. Last year, CSI and CSI: Miami were its best performing imported dramas and CSI: NY was expected to join them, but the series was rushed to air with almost no fanfare to counter Seven's blockbuster dramas Lost and Desperate Housewives, and may have suffered from the lack of publicity.

Its performance might also suggest the police procedural genre has reached saturation point. Television spin-offs have always been risky ventures, but until now procedural dramas bucked the trend. Law & Order has given birth to three offshoots (Special Victims Unit, Criminal Intent and Trial by Jury) and CSI to two. Television is like the oil business, and eventually the dilemma arises: do you cap the well or pump it dry?

The relatively soft ratings in the US for CSI: NY and Law & Order: Trial by Jury could be the first sign that the genre is being pumped too hard.  <quote> "It might be that nobody knew what the saturation point was for the crime shows," </quote>  Los Angeles Times TV critic Brian Lowry wrote last year.  <quote> "Maybe we're seeing the cusp." </quote> 

Even within the CSI family, there has been angst about the risks associated with diluting the franchise. CSI actor Gary Dourdan told US journalists earlier this year that the spin-offs were  <quote> "just not as good" </quote>  and  <quote> "kind of contrived" </quote> .

His co-star, Jorja Fox, was equally disparaging.  <quote> "They weren't anybody's creative brainchild. They came out of a way to make as much money as quickly as possible," </quote>  she said.

None of this has stopped chatter about CSI: New Orleans (yep, it even has a title), though it's difficult to know whether the whispers are a hangover from aborted plans to make that city the location of the second spin-off or genuine discussions.

If there is to be a third, Zuiker says it will be without him.  <quote> "This is definitely it. We're out of show producers," </quote>  he says, laughing.  <quote> "CSI: NY has a long, long way to go and until this show is at a 25-30 per cent share consistently there would be no reason to do another show. If you put another flavour of soda in the refrigerator, eventually people will quench their thirst. You have to watch that." </quote> 

CSI: NY airs on Nine on Tuesdays at 9.30pm.

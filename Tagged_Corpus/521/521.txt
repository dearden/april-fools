Manchester City's owners have bought Uruguayan side Atletico Torque.

The club play in the Second Division of the Uruguayan league and have had two top-six finishes in two years.

The City Football Group already owns clubs in Australia, Japan and the United States and the purchase of Atletico Torque is seen as a way of increasing scouting in South America.

City have also entered a collaboration agreement with Atletico Venezuela of the Primera Division of Venezuela.

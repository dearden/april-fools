In unprecedented move Google announced today on their blog that they will integrate the recently acquired affiliate network with their Product Search functionality to offer financially strapped US consumers context relevant coupon codes and discounts as they shop online.

This comes as no surprise to me. The recent acquisition of Performics has demonstrated the mega-company is not shy of entering the affiliate market, and the success of Google Adsense has clearly demonstrated the power of context relevant ads. Now, with all the talks about click spam and lowered number of clicks on these ads, Google had to come up with something to fight back the downturn and make their investors happy.
Please meet Google Shopping Deals!

Google Shopping Deals

How does Google Shopping Deals work? Actually quite simple. Google already had all the pieces in place and it was just a matter of putting them together.

Affiliate offers (coupons and promotions) are channeled through Performics network to the Google Shopping Deals servers
Software similar to Google Adsense constantly crawls Google Product Search pages and analyzes the content
Coupon codes and promotions are displayed on the pages next to the products offered by merchants, offering extra discounts on the featured or similar merchandise from competing merchants.

As a trial, Google Shopping Deals has been introduced to a limited number of merchandise categories, and only on Product Search pages, but I clearly see Google adopting this great new product to their main search as well. In fact it would perfectly fit the recently spotted (and highly controversial) secondary search feature.

A magnitude-7.2 earthquake shook Baja California on the afternoon of Sunday, April 4. It was felt from San Diego to Mexicali to Phoenix. There was some damage, but thankfully, casualties were low.

We turned to Twitter for a closer look at the earthquake's impact on the communities along the Pacific. These photos of the damage in Mexicali and other locales were shared via Twitter and TwitPic this afternoon by people who experienced the earthquake first-hand.

We saw it (perhaps more aptly) after the Chile earthquake, too: Social media can make personal experiences universal. Twitter advocates like to talk about how much more quickly news and images can get out through the service, but that's not the only thing that's changed in today's world as a result of social media.

Have you found any compelling photos of the quake on Twitter or Facebook today? If so, feel free to share them in the comments.

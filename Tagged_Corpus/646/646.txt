Harry The Viking Diamond Jubilee National Hunt steeplechase in March

Sir Alex Ferguson is poised for a return to Scotland in search of another piece of top sporting silverware - at the Scottish Grand National.

The horse he part owns, Harry The Viking, is a likely runner after the Paul Nicholls-trained seven-year-old was named among the entries.

Manchester United are in action the following day against Everton.

So the United manager may well be at Ayr to cheer on his horse in the Â£180,000 race on Saturday, 21 April.

But there will be stiff competition, with some of the country's top chasers featuring among the 62 entries.

Nicky Henderson has five possible runners, including Burton Port, who was fourth at the Cheltenham Gold Cup, and David Pipe has entered one of the Grand National favourites, Junior, and also The Package, owned by David Johnson.

Cheltenham's JLT Speciality Chase winner, Alfie Sherrin, from Jonjo O'Neill's yard, and Hennessey Gold Cup winner Carruthers are entered, as is the 2010 winner of the race and last year's runner-up, Merigo.

Notable Scottish-trained entries other than Merigo include Lucinda Russell pair Red Harbour and Etxalar, Willie Amos's Lie Forrit, Abbeybraney, from George Bewley's yard and the James Ewart-trained Captain Americo.

Made from a modified Zimmer, a skateboard deck and polyurethane wheels, the newly unveiled Micro Zimmer looks like something from the latest extreme sport craze.

But it is actually designed for pensioners who want to opt for something a little more speedy than the traditional four-footed frame which is normally more associated with hospitals than pavement-surfing.

British company Micro Scooters, which manufactures the new £100 vehicle, claims it was developed in response to  <quote> “huge demand” </quote>  from grandmas and granddads who wanted to take their grandchildren to school, but found they were struggling to keep pace.

They claim that with the Micro Zimmer's top speed of 10mph it may soon be the grandchildren doing the chasing.

As well as giving pensioners a speed boost, the Micro Zimmer is also lightweight enough for the more agile OAPs to perform bunny hops and mild stunts, according to its makers. Retired legal secretary Delia Hargrave, who is in her 80s, is one of the first to adopt the Micro Zimmer.

She has also decked it out with various lights and badges, as well as a pink bag for keeping her purse and other important items in.

Mrs Hargrave, of Hanley Castle, Worcestershire, said:  <quote> “I think it is wonderful. Now we can get our own back at all those little ones on their scooters.” </quote>  The grandmother of four added:  <quote> “You can also get special rubber bands for the wheels to slow it down until you're ready to pick up the pace.” </quote> 

She said she gets a lot of attention when she's out and about.  <quote> “It's a great conversation starter.” </quote>

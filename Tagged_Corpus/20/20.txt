One terabyte of free online email storage is on offer from British researchers beta testing a quantum-based, grid computing spam filter.

The project, run by London's Supercomputing Methods Experimental Group (SMEG), aims to prove the commercial viability of the group's revolutionary spam filtering technology announced two years ago.

It uses microscopic black holes - created when cosmic rays travelling at near the speed of light collide with tiny particles in the Earth's atmosphere - to form a grid of ultra high speed  <quote> "write only" </quote>  memory.

The group's one terabyte SMEGmail project will initially be invitation-only, and the announcement comes as Yahoo! increases the inbox capacity of its free web mail service to one gigabyte - matching what is offered by Google's Gmail and exceeding what Microsoft's Hotmail offers.

The spam filtering technology is based on the research of Austrian theoretical physicist Erwin Schrodinger, says SMEG spokeswoman Shirley Knott.

 <quote> "Just as Schrodinger's cat is both dead and alive until you open the box, when your inbox is reduced to an sub-atomic level every email will be both spam and non-spam until it is opened," </quote>  Knott says.

Being quantum based, SMEGmail may in future permit omnipresent Instant Messaging - allowing users to be everywhere in the universe at once. The use of entangled quantum pairs - two particles that stay in synch no matter how far apart they are, somehow exchanging information faster than light - could allow Instant Instant Messaging.

The developers are still struggling with location-based SMEGsearch, which at the moment tells you every pizza shop in the world is simultaneously your nearest fast food outlet.

SMEGmail's use of quantum computing has already caught the attention of NASA, which is beta testing the service after a torrent of interplanetary spam crippled the onboard computer of the Mars Spirit rover this time last year.

People from Birmingham should keep mum if they want to avoid appearing stupid, new research suggests.

A study matching accents with perceived intelligence found that speaking  <quote> “Brummie” </quote>  gave an even worse impression than having nothing to say.

Yorkshire folk, on the other hand, should open their mouths as much as possible, according to the findings.

Their accent was rated the most intelligent-sounding, beating the clipped vowels and precise diction of what is popularly known as the Queen's English.

Scientists asked 48 volunteers to look at photos of female models while listening to recordings of women with different accents describing their lives.

They were then asked to rate the pictured models for intelligence, giving them marks out of 10. Scores were given for Yorkshire, Birmingham and RP (received pronunciation, or  <quote> “Queen's English” </quote> ) accents, and volunteers were also asked to give an intelligence rating when no voice was played.

The researchers found that accents made no difference to perceptions of attractiveness, but had a significant impact on whether or not a particular model was seen as intelligent.

Dr Lance Workman, who led the research at Bath Spa University, said:  <quote> “One of reasons for doing this study was to find out about stereotypes.
 </quote> 
 <quote> “Surveys have shown that a lot of people associate Birmingham with criminal activity, and they associate criminal activity with low intelligence.” </quote> 

He added hastily:  <quote> “Can I just say that whenever I've been to Birmingham I've found people to be very bright and friendly.” </quote> 

Broadcast media, especially the BBC, were also likely to have been an important influence, said Dr Workman.

Yorkshire is no longer associated with collieries and 1980s industrial unrest, with Yorkshire folk now seen in a positive light and perceived as  <quote> “wise, trustworthy, honest and straightforward” </quote> .

Famous Brummies include comedian Jasper Carrott and pop star Ozzy Osbourne.

But technology stocks failed to fire recently as much as other sectors. Still, shareholder sentiment was buoyant enough to facilitate a first-day jump for Spotify as the music streaming service made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock closed 12.9 per cent above its reference price of $132, but had pulled back from its opening trade that briefly had it more than 25 per cent higher. The S&P 500 closed 1.3 per cent higher, having dropped 2.2 per cent on Monday. The benchmark was back above its 200-day moving average, a closely watched measure of momentum, having closed below that threshold yesterday for the first time in almost two years. Source FT

REDDING, Calif. â€” A woman who slammed into a line of vehicles while text messaging on her cell phone was sentenced to six years in prison for killing a woman whose car was rear-ended and exploded in flames.

Investigators said Deborah Matis-Engle was speeding and text messaging when she slammed into vehicles stopped at a construction zone on Aug. 13, 2007.

Shasta County prosecutor Stephanie Bridgett said the 49-year-old had paid several bills by cell phone in the moments before the crash. She was in the middle of one of those transactions when she hit 46-year-old Petra Winn's car, killing her.

Matis-Engle's attorney, Jeffrey Stotter, said he will appeal her vehicular manslaughter conviction and the sentence she received Friday.

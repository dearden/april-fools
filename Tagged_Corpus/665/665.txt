Ronaldinho will miss the rest of Barcelona's season after tearing a muscle in his right leg. The Brazilian, 28, suffered the injury in training on Thursday and scans confirmed he will be out of the game for around six weeks.

He has been plagued by a succession of injury and fitness problems in the past year and there have been reports the club want to sell him in the summer.

The Catalans were boosted, however, by news that the Argentina forward Lionel Messi hopes to have recovered from his injury in time for a possible Champions League semi-final meeting with Manchester United.

The club's Portuguese playmaker Deco, who is also returning from injury, had hoped to make his comeback against Getafe tomorrow but also pulled up in training.

In Italy, Francesco Totti is out of Roma's game against Genoa as he struggles to overcome a thigh problem in time for Wednesday's Champions League return against United.

The Milan captain Paolo Maldini has yet to decide if he will retire at the end of the season.  <quote> "I'm thinking about [playing on] even if every morning I wake up with a different idea," </quote>  the 39-year-old said.

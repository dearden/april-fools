WORLD superbike champion James Toseland is coming to Scotland to play a charity gig with his rock band.

James, who first won a world championship when he was just 15, will perform with four-piece Crash at the Renfrew Ferry in Glasgow on Saturday, April 17.

And the sports superstar promised some high-octane rock 'n' roll at the show, which is a fundraiser for the Clic Sargent childrens' cancer charity.

He said:  <quote> "I've played with them for almost eight years now. The band is a hobby but it is also a passion.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "It is nice to have something to take my mind off the racing because everything else in my life, whether eating or training, is preparing myself to race motorcycles.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "It is all covers. We sing Guns n' Roses' Sweet Child O' Mine, which tends to be our encore, Sex On Fire by Kings Of Leon and lots of good rock 'n' roll.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "Because we don't play that often, we have a lot of fun onstage and I think that comes across in the performance. There's plenty of crowd interaction and we'll have a good laugh up there." </quote> 

Fundraiser Lynda Mackin, from Renfrewshire ,who is also taking part in the Barry Sheen memorial challenge 2010 in aid of the charity, said:  <quote> "I had seen James and the band on the Isle Of Man and his PR told me the band had never played in Scotland." </quote> 

Crash frontman Paul Grant-Reason, who is half-Scottish, asked James to join 12 years ago.

He said:  <quote> "Back in 1998, James wasn't that well known. I grew up with riding because my dad was a speedway rider so I spotted him and went over. James couldn't believe anyone had recognised him.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "We became friends and a couple of years later, I heard him play piano. I thought we should get a band together and we started doing gigs. It has got bigger and better with time.
 </quote> 
Paul added:  <quote> "He's a twice world champion motorcyclist, so you would have to say he is a better bike rider." </quote> 

James said:  <quote> "The rest of the band are professional musicians. Their bread and butter is playing in Kings Of Leon and Robbie Williams tribute acts called Kings Of Neon and Let Me Entertain You." </quote> 

James, who studied piano as a child, rode his first motorbike when he was just nine and he became junior world champion while still at school.

He now rides with Yamaha and confessed he will be playing the Glasgow gig with a broken hand after crashing his bike in an Australian superbike race.

He explained:  <quote> "I broke my hand and I've got an MRI scan on Tuesday. It is on the mend but I need to make sure exactly what has happened to it.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "I crashed in the first race weekend in Australia. I got 13 injections and away we went. You don't get a sick note in this job.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "The break is in the base of my hand,so my fingers are all right for playing keyboards.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "This is my third year riding for Yamaha, who are a great company to ride for because they also make keyboards and musical instruments." </quote>  Tickets for the gig cost Â£15 each plus 75p booking fee. Tickets must be pre-booked, not on the door. The gig is restricted to age 14 and over.

Tickets are on sale at Ticket Scotland in Argyle Street, Glasgow, and at Ticketsoup.com.

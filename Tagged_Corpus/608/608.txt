Gaming mouse utilizes infrared technology for ultra-high accuracy.

RAZER today announced the newest product in its lineup of gaming mice, the Diamondback Plasma Limited Edition Mouse. The Diamondback Plasma is an infrared sensor mouse with an optical engine that is touted to deliver the same high-performance operability that RAZER is known for.

The RAZER Diamondback Plasma Limited Edition is powered by the RAZER Precision infrared sensor engine, featuring a framerate of over 6,400 frames per second, or 5.8 megapixels per second, running on a 16-bit data path. It also features ultra-high speed motion detection of up to 40ips and 15g, for both low and high-sensitivity players. Physically, the Diamond Plasma Limited Edition features the same ambidextrous profile as the standard RAZER Diamondback.

The RAZER Diamondback Plasma Limited Edition is currently slated to ship in May.

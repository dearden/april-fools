Shadow, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier-Collie, was one of three dogs to go through flight school as part of Sky 1 series Dogs Might Fly.

The aircraft's controls were modified so Shadow could hit buttons in response to certain sounds.

His human co-pilot got Shadow airborne before the pooch pilot took the controls.

He told The Independent:  <quote> "Given that we would not expect a human three-year-old to be able to fly a plane, I would not expect that a dog could do so either." </quote> 

Producers worked alongside the Civil Aviation Authority to meet strict safety guidelines while filming the series.

The Dogs Might Fly finalé airs on Sky 1 on Sunday at 7pm.

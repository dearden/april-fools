The Tiger Woods Foundation was established in 1996 by Tiger Woods and his father Earl to empower young people to reach their highest potential by initiating and supporting community-based programs that promote the health, education and welfare of all of America's children. TWF started reaching out to young people primarily through junior golf clinics and a national grant program.  From these efforts evolved fundraising events such as the Target World Challenge and Tiger Jam.

The Foundation has grown to include participation in Target House at St. Jude Hospital in Memphis, Tenn.; the Start Something character development program created through our partnership with Target Stores; and the construction and development of the Tiger Woods Learning Center, an educational facility located in Anaheim, Calif. Tiger and Earl started the Foundation based on the belief that we all have the responsibility to help young people achieve their dreams. With the help of many friends and supporters, the Foundation has reached out to millions of children across the country.

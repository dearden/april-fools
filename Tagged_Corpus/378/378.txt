Residents in Tamworth are being told to stay indoors following the escape of two black panthers from Drayton Manor's zoo.

The adult animals were released from the theme park following a break-in of their enclosure during the early hours of this morning.

A spokesman for Tamworth Police said:  <quote> “Panthers will usually avoid human contact, but could attack if frightened or startled.

 <quote> “We're advising the public to remain indoors at this time, and appeal for any sightings of the creatures to be reported to us immediately.
 </quote> 
 <quote> “A large town will be an extremely alien environment for big cats of this type and their swift capture is in interests of both the public and animals themselves.” </quote> 

Andrew Webber, owner of the Tamworth's Bengali Olaf Priol restaurant said that he woke to discover claw-like marks across the paintwork of his Jaguar sports car.

 <quote> “I went to get in the car to pick up my morning paper at around 5:30am, and I noticed what appeared to be a huge slash mark across the door,” </quote>  he said.

 <quote> “There was no sign of anyone or anything nearby, but I was convinced that they had been caused by an animal of some kind.” </quote> 

Drayton Manor has said that the theme park will be open as usual on Monday, although the zoo will be off limits until the animals had been recaptured.

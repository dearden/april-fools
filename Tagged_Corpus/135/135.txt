Composer Danny Elfman recently recorded his score to the upcoming action film Terminator Salvation at the Sony Scoring Stage, in Culver City. Originally due to record with a full orchestra, the turbulent economic situation resulted in a bit of a budget cutback. That forced Elfman to take a unique approach to the film – scoring it only with a ukulele.

Director McG, who originally had considered going with Oscar-winning composer Gustavo Santaolalla, turned to Elfman when he realized that Elfman had the perfect ability to composer for organic instruments, and cold electronics for the machines.  <quote> "I wanted a soft and pleasing sound to represent the humanity," </quote>  explained Elfman.  <quote> "And there is no one better in this industry to bring that to life than George Doering." </quote> 

Doering recorded over 84-minutes of music for Elfman, all on the ukulele. He had to perform plenty of overdubs, and was at the Sony Scoring Stage for over 17 days in March.  <quote> "It's tiring work," </quote>  George said with a smile,  <quote> "but I love it!" </quote>

We can confirm that Elfman indeed is using the classic Brad Fiedel Terminator theme, but – like Mission: Impossible – it will have a decidedly unique tone to it.  <quote> "I absolutely love what Danny did with this score," </quote>  said McG.  <quote> "It will blow everyone away when they hear it in the film – some sequences will be only music, no sound effects. It will add to the human drama I'm trying to convey." </quote> 

Director McG and composer Danny Elfman discuss a cue

To make things even more exciting, McG begged Warner Brothers to go the extra mile and secure two-time Oscar-winning composer A.R. Rahman to write and perform a new end-title song,  <quote> "Mein Machine Sey Pyar Karta Hoon" </quote> . A music video for the song was filmed recently, with Rahman as well as actor Christian Bale, and a bevy of Bollywood beauties. Warner Brothers Records, who will release the soundtrack album on May 19, 2009, has provided us with an exclusive photo from the music video for  <quote> "Mein Machine Sey Pyar Karta Hoon" </quote> .

We've also been provided with an exclusive clip from Elfman's score, available below.

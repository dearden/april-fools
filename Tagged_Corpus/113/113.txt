Apple's Steve Jobs has struck a deal with Microsoft to sell Windows Vista operating system with its popular range of Mac notebooks, desktops and workstations.

Speaking from Apple's Headquarters in Cupertino, CA, Apple's CEO, Steve Jobs said  <quote> "Embracing existing Windows users is a great way for Apple to evangelise our ease of use and allow Mac users to run Windows-Only applications" </quote> .

Jobs added that running Windows Vista and OS X along each other was a logical next step since it allowed Mac users to benefit from the best of both worlds; this has been made easier as Windows and Mac computer now share the same microarchitecture.

Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing, added that  <quote> "Many customers have expressed their interest to run Windows on Apple's superior hardware now that we use Intel processors and we think that the move will make the Mac even more appealing to Windows users considering making the switch" </quote> .

He downplayed security issues saying that both Operating system would be running separately and that any malware would have a tough time trying to migrate from one platform to another.

Previously, Apple users had to use Bootcamp or Parallels in order to run Windows Operating system; Apple will sell Windows Vista at suggested retail prices but has said that it will not support the Operating system..

HOLY SHIT !!
Zack Snyder has cited the pressures of directing the Justice League movies, following three years of work on Batman v Superman as the key reason for dropping out of the Warner Brothers upcoming project.

Snyder told the Los Angeles Times that he wants to do a lower profile project rather than another huge DC movie after working on Dawn of Justice
 <quote> “I want to do something original after this because I've been living under public scrutiny, as you've seen, for the last three years of my life,” </quote>  he told the newspaper.  <quote> “And it's not healthy for me right now in my life. I want to do something that's below the radar.” </quote> 
Snyder's statement Thursday said only that he made a  <quote>  <quote> “personal decision to move forward on a different path. ” </quote>  I've put a tremendous amount of thought into this, and I know deep down in my heart that I want to pursue some original creative opportunities.” </quote> 
He told the Times that he had hoped there would be no lingering fallout from the decision to leave the  <quote> “Justice League” </quote>  movie.  That has not been the case, as fans and industry insiders are , of course, citing the critical response to BvS , and the fact that it might even not turn a profit during its theatrical run.
 <quote> “At first I was like, ‘I'm just not going to say anything because it will blow over,'” </quote>  he said.  <quote> “But I was shocked – it just hasn't blown over. People get so excited to raise their pitchforks. I knew that this was going to be questioned and it was going to come under skepticism as to why Im leaving Justice League. And it was hard. It was the hardest decision I've ever had to make in my life.” </quote>

Speculation emerged following the announcement that Snyder has been fired from the  film due to critical response to Batman v Superman and that a rift has opened up between Snyder and  <quote> “Justice League” </quote>  producer Geoff Johns.
 <quote> “None of those facts are true – and any of the facts that were true were spun in such a maliciously wrong way,” </quote>  Snyder said.
Snyder also said he and Johns have become  <quote> “closer” </quote>  friends as a result.
 <quote> “It feels sometimes like I'm living in a Paddy Chayefsky script or something like that,” </quote>  he said.  <quote> “Every misconception that could possibly be made about this has been made to a hilariously satirical degree. And it's people who haven't met me before. If they met me – I don't know, I feel like I'm a pretty harmless person.” </quote> 
Geoff Johns ,Chief Creative Officer at DC Comics as well as producer was asked about the reported reshoots for the Suicide Squad , and if the reshoots would effect the planned August release .  He gave no comment.

The Justice League movie is not expected to be released until 2017 as the first of two JL movies that Warner brothers are developing.  It was set to begin shooting in April, but now that has a huge question mark next to it. Early speculation is that producer George Miller might take the job, but so far this has not been confirmed. Another possibility is that Ben Affleck, who reportedly has been working closely with Johns on a solo Batman script, could take on the directing job.
What do you guys think ?
Are you buying into any of this. Was he fired, or is Snyder's reasons true ?

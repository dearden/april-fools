Topeka, Kansas — The Westboro Baptist Church has made history today, appointing its first openly gay minister. James Arrington, a 32-year-old minister hopes that he will set an example for others.

James Arrington is an openly gay minister who grew up in Topeka, Kansas.

In an interview with Equalitopia, Arrington said that he did not expect to be appointed a minister into the church.  <quote> “I'm not sure exactly what it was,” </quote>  he explained,  <quote> “but I felt like I wouldn't really fit into the church.” </quote> 

Arrington hopes that being gay will set an example for the church's members that God is accepting of everyone.  <quote> “I plan on encouraging others in the church not to be afraid of their sexuality,” </quote>  he said,  <quote> “we just need to be ourselves and live by the word of God.” </quote> 

Gay rights advocates call it a major victory for the LGBT movement, hoping that the Westboro Baptist Church will set an example for others.

The Westboro Baptist Church has not disclosed when Arrington's first church service will take place, in fear that the public might protest the service.

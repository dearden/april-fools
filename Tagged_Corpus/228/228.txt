By noon Thursday, more than 100 people had commented on the story online. A phoneline created as part of the prank rang off the hook all morning.

A voice message told callers they had been duped.

Many callers chuckled before hanging up.

In jest, the story claimed the feds were planning to start taxing Internet usage in an effort to pay down the country's swelling deficit.

Written by a fictitious Seamus Levy, the story goes on to report that so-called sin sites - those offering pornography, gambling or social networking - would be the most heavily taxed.

 <quote> "Got me," </quote>  wrote Dan Percy on the related Facebook group, Stop the iTax in Canada.

 <quote> "Wish I clicked on this link before firing off those nasty, threatening emails to our find Members of Parliament." </quote> 

Others weren't so amused.

 <quote> "I am already paying (lots) of taxes," </quote>  wrote Facebook user Sudhagar Rathinam.

 <quote> "It is outrageous. Stop Internet tax." </quote> 

Commenting on the Edmonton Sun site, reader Jamie was also outraged.

 <quote> "This is ridiculous," </quote>  Jamie exclaimed.  <quote> "Our children use the Internet for school and now we have to limit the use of it 'cause it's going to cost us money." </quote> 

But not everyone was had.

 <quote> "We are onto your tricks," </quote>  one reader said.

 <quote> "You gotta try harder." </quote>

Critics are calling it the iTax.

The federal government says it will soon tax Internet usage in an effort to pay down the country's swelling deficit.

 <quote> "The bills are piling up and we need to find new streams of revenue to keep up," </quote>  said government spokesman Earl White.

 <quote> "This isn't really a tax. It's more of a user fee. Those who don't want to pay, can just live offline. The majority of Canadians do just fine without the Internet." </quote> 

While White wouldn't say precisely when the tax will bite users, insiders say it will happen in days.

White says the plan will force Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to monitor customers' web surfing and turn a usage report over to the feds at the end of the year for taxation.

The plan is to tax each site visit based on the page's content.

News and so-called sin sites - those offering pornography, gambling or social networking - will be the most heavily taxed, he said, though the rate of taxation has not yet been set.

However, White pointed out, all government web sites will remain free of the tax, though there will likely be a small fee if you use Google to get to them.

 <quote> "If people don't want to pay the levy to get news on what's happening in government, they can get their news directly from the government free of charge," </quote>  said White.  <quote> "Kind of makes sense to go directly to the source." </quote> 

Don Loader, president of the Free Online from Our Parliament Association (FOOPA) called the move  <quote> "information highway robbery." </quote> 

Bill Torrent, with the People's Army of the Forced Awakening, said his group, too, is outraged by the move.

 <quote> "This is sick," </quote>  said Torrent.  <quote> "What's next? A tax on TV? Books? Gasoline?
 </quote> 
 <quote> "The simple fact is this government is afraid of an educated population." </quote> 

Oliver DeNet, a spokesman for the newly formed Taxes in Technology committee, says people shouldn't prejudge the plan.

 <quote> "This is no different than paying that extra little fee when you go to an ATM machine. And no one complains about that do they?" </quote>  he said.

And while opposition members are upset by the tax, insiders say they are afraid to come out against it.

 <quote> "We don't want to be painted as supporting news, Facebook or pornography. And that's what will happen," </quote>  said one insider.

Loader and his FOOPA freedom fighters have begun a petition, but not online, to avoid the tax.

Ironically though, a Stop the iTax in Canada! group has shown up on Facebook.

Loader says those who want to join the battle against the tax can call 780-468-0170.

Blackpool manager Paul Ince has placed a £25m price tag on his son, Tom, after claiming the England Under-21 winger has outshone Manchester United-bound Wilfried Zaha in the Championship this season. 

Zaha, who made his senior England debut against Sweden earlier this season, will complete a £15m move to United this summer after Crystal Palace agreed to sell the 20-year-old in January.

Blackpool youngster Ince has outscored Zaha for the Bloomfield Road club this season, however, and prompted former club Liverpool to make moves to take the 21-year-old back to Anfield.

And Ince senior insists that his son will command a fee in excess of Zaha's valuation if he leaves Blackpool as expected this summer.

 <quote> "If you look at Zaha being sold for £15m, then Thomas has to be worth £25m," </quote>  Ince said.  <quote> "If you compare the two, Thomas has to be worth much more.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "Zaha is a fantastic player, don't get me wrong, but look at the way Thomas plays and his statistics. He has about 26 assists and 18 goals.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "Thomas is direct and makes things happen, and he scores goals." </quote> 

Ince senior, linked with a move to Leicester this week, has even claimed to have seen similarities between Tom and Cristiano Ronaldo.

 <quote> "I'll never compare him to Ronaldo but he's that sort of wide man who scores goals," </quote>  Ince said.

 <quote> "The rest of the top scorers in the league are strikers. In terms of potential, he can reach £25m in value.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "Zaha had five or six goals and Palace got £15m. Well, Thomas has 18. That shows just what quality he can bring.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "We aren't going to get £25m as he's not proven in the Premier League, but if United paid £15m for Zaha you'd say Thomas is worth a lot more." </quote>

US President George W. Bush declared today that he had signed a rare Presidential Decree canceling any further expenditure of Federal funds on the US Space Shuttle program.

 <quote> "We cannot find any justification to continue the deficit funding of a program that has no application other that proving that with enough money America can do anything," </quote>  said Bush.

 <quote> "The whole world knows that already, so why keep spending money on it," </quote>  he added.

The announcement was made during an even rarer press conference with the Whitehouse press corps, at which the President started proceedings by handing out Easter Eggs, quipping,  <quote> "it might be politically incorrect to hand these out, but don't worry we got them on discount at a Wal-Mart sale so they aren't really religious items anymore." </quote> 

With the press left looking like stunned bunnies, the President took to the podium before dropping today's bombshell that Congressional supporter's of the Space Shuttle have told SpaceDaily,  <quote> "will cost thousands of jobs, and leave school children confused as to what America can actually do in space anymore." </quote> 

During the press conference Bush told reporters,  <quote> "I don't want to see another NASA administrator - appointed on my watch - left to justify a program to Congress based on lies, dis-information, half-truths and sexed up reports." </quote> 

During a brief two-minute period provided for questions from the press, the first reporter asked if this meant the Space Station was also being shut down. To which the President answered,  <quote> "we plan to either hold an auction on Ebay or give it away to <quote> "our international partners." </quote> " </quote>

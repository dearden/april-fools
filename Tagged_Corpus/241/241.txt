Scotland's hardest Munro, the Inaccessible Pinnacle on the Isle of Skye, is no more after collapsing yesterday in a gigantic rockfall as the Cuillin were swept by hurricane force winds and blizzard conditions. The news broke yesterday evening after an ascent of Sgurr Dearg in appalling weather conditions by one of the island's mountain guides.

Walkers are warned to avoid the An Stac screes above Coire Lagan – and the former ramp that ran along the side of the pinnacle – both of which are littered with huge lumps of broken and highly unstable rock.

Sgurr Dearg will replace the Pinnacle as a Munro, making the ascent of all the peaks much easier than before, though the news will come as a blow to the Skye guiding industry which has grown up around helping clients ascend the ‘In Pinn' as it was known.

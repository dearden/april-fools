It is down to the discretion of the referee, but the player could be dismissed if the swearing was deemed to be excessive and/or unnecessary. It depends on the context of the incident, as there is no black-and-white rule.

Are there any circumstances under which a player can swear and not risk being sent off or charged by the FA?

There is no swearing loophole in the rule book, so players and managers must simply mind their language and, if they do swear, only do so in a manner which does not risk offending, abusing or insulting somebody.

Arriva Trains Wales trial of QR Codes on trains has run into the buffers! The QR Codes are supposed to resolve to a PDF download of the train's relevant timetable. However a reader has emailed me an image (below) of one of the trains showing the QR Code on the front of the Barry Island to Merthyr Tydfil train. This particular train's QR Code resolves to the timetable for a totally different route, Swansea to Shrewsbury. The reader tells me that when he pointed this out to station staff they said that the company's rolling stock was often moved around on the Arriva Trains network depending on service schedules and availability. Apparently the station staff have taken to betting on whether or not the next train's QR Code resolves to the correct timetable.

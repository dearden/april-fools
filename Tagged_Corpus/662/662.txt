Port Antonio, Portland:

Portland is getting ready to choose the lady who will represent the parish at this year's Festival Queen Competition.

Eight women are now vying for that opportunity after they were sashed almost two weeks ago in the ballroom of Hotel Timbamboo in Port Antonio.

The eight not only have to perfect their various talents over the next few weeks, they will also have to ensure that perfection is on show on May 14 during the parish's grand coronation at the Port Antonio High school.

Those vying for Portland supremacy are: Sherehelia Hall, Miss Mack D's Auto Sales; Mikhail-Lee Myles, Miss Mizpah Funeral Supplies; Kristina Wright, Miss Prospect; Latoya Clarke, Miss Lees Maxi Mart; Tara-Lee Tracey, Miss Tropical Money Systems Ltd; Mauricia Smart, Miss Nicole's Artistry Beauty Salon; Nicole Hopkins, Miss Hotel Timbamboo; and Kashana Duncan, Miss Coronation Bakery.

The girls' trainers over the next few weeks are Marlise Cowie Adiansingh, Kemoy Phillips, and Sonia Mathews.

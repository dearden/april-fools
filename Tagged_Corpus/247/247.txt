An old friend from college who is now a scout for the Philadelphia Eagles just informed me of this breaking news.

The St. Louis Rams decided to address their quarterback issue before the draft as opposed to spending a boat load of money on Oklahoma's Sam Bradford. In a three team deal, the Rams unloaded their first overall pick in the 2010 NFL Draft for their quarterback of the future.
Rams Get

QB - Brett Favre
Eagles Get

First overall pick in the 2010 NFL Draft
Vikings Get

QB - Donovan McNabb

I guess everyone makes out on this deal. The Rams have gotten a proven NFL quarterback that knows the system that they will run in the NFC. As to whether or not Brett Favre is or isn't coming back next season, well don't worry, that's in the contract of the trade. If Favre decides not to come back and play, the Rams will get Donovan McNabb and the Vikings will get Michael Vick. The Eagles will then receive the first overall pick and Tavaris Jackson. The Rams are taking the same approach that Childress was taking with Favre and just waiting until he makes a decision without pressuring him.

The Vikings are replacing the older version of Favre with a veteran, slightly more mobile, Donovan McNabb. McNabb is no stranger to making the playoffs year in and year out, now having Adrian Peterson and the Vikings young receiving corps, maybe he can get over that hump.

The Eagles are the big winner in this deal. In addition to their previous first round picks with LeSean McCoy and DeSean Jackson, the Eagles clear some cap by getting rid of McNabb and letting Kevin Kolb step up and prove himself with Michael Vick as a legitimate back up. The Eagles can then use the first overall pick for anything they choose, maybe boost up their defense or even give Kold more weapons on offense, or we could see the pick move again before the Draft. Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

Thanks to rubendn for the picture of Brett Favre.

Around 240 children from across Berkshire competed in tag rugby and netball competitions at a Festival of Sport hosted by Beechwood Primary School in Woodley.

Youngsters from 13 schools across Wokingham, West Berkshire, Bracknell and Oxfordshire took part in rugby and netball tournaments on Thursday last week.

Fourteen school rugby teams and 10 netball teams were placed into leagues with the top four in each sport battling it out the semi-finals for a place in the final for each sport.

Meadow Vale Primary School in Bracknell won both competitions, overcoming Harmans Water 5-3 in the rugby and Beechwood 4-2 in the netball.

Pupils from The Forest School in Winnersh helped out with refereeing the rugby, while Beechwood Primary School's PTA sold refreshments to raise funds to renovate the school swimming pool.

Teaching assistant Ben Berryman, who organised the event, said:  <quote> “It was a great afternoon and everyone that came really involved themselves in the tournament.

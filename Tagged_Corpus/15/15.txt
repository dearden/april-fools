In a move to prove that the pen is mightier than the sword, Microsoft announced today that they are taking the first steps to combine the ever-popular MMO genre and productivity software. Hailed as the first MMOWP (that's massively multiplayer online word processor), Microsoft revealed to IGN that World of Wordcraft has been in the works for nearly 18 months now, and is currently in beta test phase.

 <quote> "We've sold more than 157 million copies of Microsoft Word over the years," </quote>  Microsoft representative Gill Bates told us,  <quote> "and while upgrades such as WYSIWYG, extensive font libraries and the ability to insert tables directly from Microsoft Excel were nice additions, no feature this revolutionary has ever been attempted in the realm of productivity software." </quote> 

Set in the fantastical land of Pagination, World of Wordcraft pits you in the role of a heroic wordsmith saving the kingdom from the malevolent  <quote> "Typos," </quote>  horribly misshapen creatures produced by the maniacal wizard Douglass C. Perry.

Although there's no combat in World of Wordcraft, you obtain experience points, and gain levels, by increasing your typing speed over time, setting advanced indentations and correcting spelling and grammar errors in a timely manner. Achieving new levels in World of Wordcraft allows you to unlock advanced functions.

One of the advanced operations that Microsoft informed us of is an autoformat function. If the first thing you type on a page is a person's name followed by a comma, World of Wordcraft's in-package helper, Clippy, will be magically summoned, tell you that  <quote> "it appears you are typing a letter," </quote>  and will ask you if you wish to layout the rest of the page with letter formatting.

Microsoft assures us that no one will ever find this feature annoying, and that Clippy will be a constant lovable companion who will travel with you everywhere on your journeys through Pagination. Clippy can be unsummoned, but only if you find the secret pulldown menu hidden deep within the Dungeon of Two Dozen Preference Pages, a foreboding area that's hopelessly difficult to navigate.

In addition to unlocking these advanced functions, like any good MMO, users will be awarded with items such as uncommon fonts (KellyAnnGothic, anyone?), foreign language collections and new text color packs such as  <quote> "dragon's blood red" </quote>  and  <quote> "undead olive." </quote> 

Being a massively multiplayer online word processor, you can also expect plenty of community tools. In addition to the normal chat window, Microsoft plans for a full guild system, complete with reading groups, copy editing pools and group raids where you can invade opposing players' documents.

Like nearly every MMO on the market, World of Wordcraft will carry a periodic fee -- in this case $14.95/month -- in addition to an initial retail price of $199. While the price may seem high, the package also includes trial versions of ExcelQuest -- already in beta test phase -- and PowerPoint Online. Look for World of Wordcraft later this year, and as always, expect to learn more about this exciting new title as we hear it.

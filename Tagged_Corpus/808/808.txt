Super Bowl? Final Four? Been there, done that for AT&T Stadium.

Next spring, the still-world-class stadium in Arlington will host a multi-day live music and entertainment festival.

KAABOO, which has held three festivals in San Diego and recently announced a 2019 event in Grand Cayman, will bring KAABOO Texas to JerryWorld in May of 2019.

KAABOO describes itself as an upscale experience that includes a  <quote> “full spectrum of indulgences,” </quote>  including live music, comedy, craft food and drinks, and even contemporary art. The announcement claims that the typically beach-bound festival will boast a nod to Texas culture.

KAABOO Texas represents the first time a multi-day nationally recognized music and lifestyle event has ever partnered with an NFL ownership group.

 <quote> “We are always looking for innovative partnerships that allow us to provide our market and a diverse demographic with a unique opportunity to engage with us,” </quote>  Cowboys Chief Operating Officer Stephen Jones said in a release.  <quote> “KAABOO Texas is a chance for people from all over the world, football fan or not, to experience AT&T Stadium through an incredible live entertainment event.” </quote> 

With a capacity of over 100,000, AT&T Stadium is one of the largest concert venues in the world and has played host to several high-profile non-sporting events, from WrestleMania to the Country Music Awards.

 <quote> “The Cowboys pride themselves on being at the forefront of exciting industry change, making this partnership a compelling fit for both organizations,” </quote>  KAABOO brand and marketing lead Jason Felts said in the release.

A lineup for KAABOO Texas will be announced later this year.

KAABOO Del Mar's 2018 lineup features musicians Katy Perry, The Foo Fighters, Halsey and many others. Craig Ferguson, Nick Offerman and Pete Holmes are among the comedians.

If you watched the recent trailer for the upcoming  <quote> “Justice League” </quote>  movie and wondered where Superman was… There's a reason he's missing. According to a news report at USA Today, Superman's scenes have been completely removed from the film.

Director Zack Snyder told USA Today,  <quote> “It's hard to have a Justice League without Superman. But we didn't feel he was completely necessary for the story we're telling in this film.” </quote> 

Henry Cavill, who attended the Warner Bros. presentation at CinemaCon earlier this week, was only told of the decision after the presentation by Zack Snyder. Even though he was reportedly very disappointed at the news, the humble Cavill would not speak out against Snyder publicly when reached for a comment.

Ben Affleck, on the other hand, was quite vocal about the decision, telling USA Today,  <quote> “Let's be honest. Superman is somewhat overrated. You don't really need him in the Justice League when you've got Batman and these other heroes to save the day.” </quote>

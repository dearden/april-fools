Reports are coming in that this spring Disney World is going to be cancelling Wishes Nighttime Spectacular.

 <quote> “Wishes” </quote>  tells a richly emotional tale about making a wish come true, using classic Disney songs and character voices accompanied by meticulously choreographed fireworks. Presented most nights,  <quote> “Wishes” </quote>  is several times larger than  <quote> “Fantasy in the Sky,” </quote>  the previous fireworks show at Magic Kingdom, and roughly five minutes longer.

Replacing Wishes will be all all new fireworks show featuring the Muppets, and will be hosted by Sam Eagle. This new show is a salute to all nations but mostly America and will be sponsored by Glock.

The date of the change over is supposed to take place to coincide with the Grand Opening of the Seven Dwarf Mine Train this spring.

Stay tuned to Chip and Co for more details…

I am glad to see the change. Wishes has to be Disney's least favorite Fireworks Presentation according to some Disney Addicts.  I want to hear what you think about the change. Are you glad to see Wishes go? Let us know in the comment box below.

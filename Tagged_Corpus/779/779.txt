Four people - one seriously hurt - survived a helicopter crash today on the outskirts of Sydney.

The Bell Jet Ranger came down in a paddock in St Albans, near Wisemans Ferry, shortly after 10am.

It is believed the helicopter was being used by Integral Energy to conduct an inspection of power lines in the area.

Mr Badham said a man in his 50s suffered severe head injuries including a cracked skull and was airlifted to Westmead Hospital.

Two other passengers - a man and a woman - suffered minor injuries and were also taken to Westmead Hospital.

The pilot suffered a minor neck injury, Mr Badham said.

Police are investigating the cause of the accident.

Integral Energy has also launched its own investigation.

In a gutsy move years in the making, every lower-case letter moved against it's upper-case counterpart in a timed action that resulted in a complete upheaval of the entire alphabet. The entire event took only 3 minutes from beginning to end. The overwhelming victory is the first since the alphabet itself was created, leaving hundreds of millions of educators around the English-speaking globe speechless.

Surprisingly, few physical injuries were reported during the clash. Several Caps (as they are known), however, are dealing with down-sizing syndrome: letters O, S, W, X & Z are struggling to understand exactly what happened and what it all means. Alphabetologists are currently sorting out the short and long-range implications. They have determined that until certain conclusions can be made, the current alphabet will remain as is. Their decision is being challenged by the lower-case coalition, said the letter  <quote> "a" </quote> , spokesman. Grief counselors have been made available around the clock to offer some closure, to dot some  <quote> "i" </quote> s and cross some  <quote> "t" </quote> s.

More than a few educators are concerned as to what this may mean going forward. Jerrold  <quote> "Gerry" </quote>  Gerald, well-known alphabetologist at the University of Florida said earlier today that  <quote> "this may very well trigger like events among punctuation marks, numbers and musical notes as well. This is just my sense of it. I have no formal training or background in either field, but i think for instance, the comma may very well attempt to overtake the period in an effort to become the most commonly used mark in the entire 'Punctuation Nation'." </quote>  There are some who fear that this may have some unintended consequences similar to the slow but steady fading of cursive handwriting as a result of world-wide digitization.

Letters involved included: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ (Capital letters, or  <quote> "Caps" </quote> ) and abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz, collectively known as lower-case letters. There are no plans to add any new letters to the current alphabet at this time.

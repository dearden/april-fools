We're thrilled to announce the opening of a fourth screen at Filmhouse, adding to our capacity to show the best in independent cinema and classic movies in the heart of Edinburgh.

SCREEN FOUR is an auditorium with a difference; a boutique bespoke artisan micro-screen, it challenges the way we think about the moving image.

An exclusive, intimate space, SCREEN FOUR has a total capacity of 6, and retains the industrial features of its original purpose. Formerly a cleaning supplies annexe – notable for it immersive citrus aroma – SCREEN FOUR is a thoroughly modern example of urban upcycling, supported by a generous grant from City of Edinburgh Council, with additional funding from Creative Scotland.



ARTIST'S IMPRESSION:

One of the key features of SCREEN FOUR is its exclusivity, accessed via a warren-like network of 4' high tunnels in the bowels of this former church. SCREEN FOUR will also screen exclusive prints, specialising in ultra-rare 9.5mm films.

Rod White, Head of Filmhouse, said:  <quote> “One of the key things we're judged on by funders is the percentage of capacity in our screens – so why not make a cinema so small it's easy to fill every night?” </quote> 

SCREEN FOUR is scheduled to open in March 2026.

THERE is no insult more damning or divisive and as the race to Westminster intensifies, it is back in the debate.

So did the SNP bring down the 1979 Labour government, paving the way for Margaret Thatcher's class war?

Weakened by crippling strikes and social unrest, Labour's minority government limped into 1979.

After a referendum on Scottish devolution was lost – amid claims it was rigged from the start with a rule that 40 per cent of voters must support it – the SNP's 11 MPs withdrew support for Jim Callaghan's government and moved a motion of no confidence.

The Nationalists' motion was superseded by one from Tory leader Thatcher and Labour mustered only 310 votes while the opposition parties secured 311 votes. Thatcher won the subsequent general election.

Here, senior SNP and Labour figures debate whether the SNP were to blame for Thatcherism and 18 years of Tory rule.

YES

Gavin Strang was MP for Edinburgh East for 40 years. He served under three Labour prime ministers and was the last MP to question Margaret Thatcher in the House of Commons.

Strang, who was junior agriculture minister in Harold Wilson and Jim Callaghan's cabinets between 1974 and 1979, believes the SNP's vote of no confidence brought down the government.

Strang, 71, said:  <quote> “We called them the Tartan Tories. They were in favour of privatisation then. They didn't cultivate a left-wing image in the way they have been doing in the past few years.
 </quote> 
 <quote> “The Labour government were going through an unpopular period and I think the SNP wanted to exploit that.
 </quote> 
 <quote> “The SNP knew fine well what they were doing. They knew the outcome was likely to be a general election.
 </quote> 
 <quote> “We were forced to go to the country in difficult times. Normally, a government goes to the country at the time of their choosing, creating circumstances that are as favourable for the party as possible.
 </quote> 
 <quote> “I think if we had been given the time, Labour would have been re-elected. But the SNP denied the Labour government that opportunity and we ended up with a Tory government.
 </quote> 
 <quote> “It showed that the SNP are quite capable of doing the Tories' work for them. This idea that the SNP can be relied upon to oppose the Tories and support a Labour government is not something you can depend on.” </quote> 

Strang was the last MP to question Thatcher in the Commons, on November 29, 1990, the day before she left Downing Street in tears. He told a packed Commons she would  <quote> “go down in history as the prime minister who rewarded the rich and punished the poor” </quote> .

Strang said:  <quote> “While everyone else was being polite towards her, I was rather robust. I didn't see the purpose or point of being polite.
 </quote> 
 <quote> “Thatcher created a very unequal society. She introduced the poll tax in Scotland a year ahead of England and Wales. You would think the SNP regretted their decision to vote against a Labour government.” </quote> 

NO

Andrew Welsh was the SNP MP who handed Michael Foot, the leader of the House of Commons, his party's motion of no confidence in the Labour government.

He said:  <quote> “It was a parliamentary session like no other. It was a time of late sittings, sometimes all-night sittings, where every vote counted. Normally
 </quote> 
governments have a majority and use that majority to sweep through the policies.

 <quote> “But in 1974-79, there was no government majority and the balance of power was held by the SNP and the other minority parties. No one knew what the result of each vote would be until it was announced.
 </quote> 
 <quote> “Devolution was Labour's policy – not ours because we wanted independence – but they failed to deliver their promise. There had been cooperation between the parties and Labour but they didn't keep their word.
 </quote> 
 <quote> “When my deputy whip Margaret Ewing and I delivered a motion of no confidence, signed by all of the SNP group, to Michael Foot, he visibly paled.
 </quote> 
 <quote> “The motion led to a government defeat and a general election, where Margaret and I both lost our seats, though we later returned. Margaret Thatcher was the rankest of rank Tories. I never like a Conservative government but that was up to the people who voted them in.” </quote> 

Welsh lost his South Angus seat in the 1979 general election but returned to Westminster between 1987 and 2001. He was an MSP between 1999 and 2011.

Welsh, 70, said of the vote of no confidence:  <quote> “I've been asked if I would do it again, and the answer is yes.
 </quote> 
 <quote> “Devolution was the Labour government's policy and they could and should have delivered it. The 40 per cent rule was a deliberate ruse to sabotage it.
 </quote> 
 <quote> “The Scottish Parliament and greater powers for Scotland came out of what happened. Without it, we would not have had our own parliament.” </quote>

Maynard James Keenan has a legacy of great music including hard rock acts Tool and A Perfect Circle, but recently he has focussed on his award winning Puscifer stage shows.  Frontier Touring are pleased to announce that Puscifer will make a series of exclusive performances around Australia in the month of August.

In a break from convention, this A is for Asstralia tour will play a range of intimate shows in the finest theatres and concert venues Australia has to offer.  These intimate shows feature completely different performances each night, and concert goers are encouraged to attend more than one show.

Musical guests for this tour include a rotating band featuring Tim Alexander (Primus),  Jonny Polonski, Gil Sharone (Dillinger Escape Plan), Dean Ween and Neil Hamburger.  Support for the tour will be Melbourne alt-country act ROOT!.

The dates for this once in a lifetime tour are:

August 10th Regent Theatre – Ballarat VIC
August 11th Regent Theatre – Ballarat VIC
August 13th Sydney Opera House – Sydney NSW
August 14th Sydney Opera House – Sydney NSW
August 17th Riverstage – Brisbane QLD
August 18th Riverstage – Brisbane QLD
August 20th Festival Centre – Adelaide SA
August 21st Festival Centre – Adelaide SA

A range of packages will be available for these events, ranging from booked seat, to VIP areas, and even a Wine Tasting Package presented by Maynard himself.  Tickets go on sale through Ticketmaster on the 31st of April.

Looks like that Tool album will be on hold for a little while longer, though I personally can't wait to see Puscifer down under!  Sadly Perth fans get shafted again, as frequently seems to be the way with small tours like this.

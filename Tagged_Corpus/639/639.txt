Duncan Harrison's body was discovered in a car

One man's body was found on Saturday night in a Mercedes car, abandoned in a cul-de-sac in Glasgow's east end.

A separate investigation has been launched into the death of a man at a flat in the Springburn area.

Meanwhile, police say they are treating the stabbing of a man in Stepps as attempted murder.

Detectives investigating the man found in the Mercedes in a cul-de-sac at Greenend Place, Springboig, have named him as Duncan Harrison, 46, from the Parkhead area.

They are anxious to trace a man spotted running from the scene just before 1930 BST.

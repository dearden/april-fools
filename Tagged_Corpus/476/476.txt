The traffic bollard in Preston's Fishergate is at the centre of a new controversy – with plans to make it taller and more visible to drivers.

Highways bosses have been left scratching their heads over why so many motorists have collided with the stone structure in the city's shared space scheme.

Cabinet member for public spaces, Coun Poolin Mahleg, says she hopes raising the bollard to 6ft in height will cut the number of prangs.

Renown road engineer Mickey Taik, who designed a shared space project in the Turkish city of Asif, has been drafted in to advise on the plans. He will be on site today to measure up the bollard, with specially matched stone materials to be shipped in from Kidin-Ah-Bout in Turkey.

Mickey said:  <quote> “We considered all options, including making a new bollard out of rubber, so vehicles would simply bounce off.

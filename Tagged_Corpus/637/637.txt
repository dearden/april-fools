Model Caroline Byrne, who died at The Gap in June 1995.

Gordon Wood was on his way back from France when police sprung the fact they planned to extradite him from England and charge him with the murder of model Caroline Byrne.

State Crime Command chief Graeme Morgan told a media conference today that NSW homicide detectives had asked the Metropolitan Police extradition unit to arrest Wood at his London home.

But when they found he wasn't at home, they telephoned him and discovered he was coming back from France.

They arranged to meet 43-year-old Wood at his home in Creechchurch Lane near the Tower of London where he was arrested at 12.45am AEST.

He is due to appear in Bow Street Magistrates Court about 7pm AEST today.

Detective Inspector Paul Jacob and Detective Senior Constable Paul Quigg will fly to England early next week to seek Wood's extradition to NSW where he will be charged with the murder of Byrne, who was found dead at the foot of The Gap at Watsons Bay on June 7, 1995.

Mr Morgan said police now had  <quote> "a very substantial brief of evidence" </quote>  to support a murder charge -  <quote> "quite voluminous" </quote>  - and the NSW Director of Public Prosecutions, Nicholas Cowdery, had decided last week that a murder charge could proceed.

 <quote> "I understand that Mr Wood was co-operative in that he provided all the information sought of him," </quote>  said Mr Morgan.

He said as far as he knew, Wood said nothing while police had him in custody.

Mr Morgan said he hoped that evidence presented to today's hearing would prevent Wood from obtaining bail.

 <quote> "How long the extradition proceedings take depends on the attitude of Mr Wood, whether he chooses to resist or not," </quote>  he said.

 <quote> "Our preference is that Mr Wood now remain in custody. It is a very serious allegation against him." </quote> 

When asked about the 12-month delay in getting advice from the DPP about whether there was sufficient evidence, he said:  <quote> "It was absolutely critical in the process that we get it right." </quote> 

He said Byrne's father, Tony Byrne, had been kept briefed on the pending arrest and police had asked him not to speak to media as he was now a crucial witness in the case.

He said the police investigation was  <quote> "a long, tortuous and arduous path that included two inquests" </quote> .

He described the efforts by Mr Jacob and Mr Quigg as  <quote> "dogged" </quote> .

 <quote> "Caroline's father has been kept informed that the arrest was imminent. He was spoken to this morning shortly after the arrest.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "He has expressed relief at the outcome and appreciation for all of the police.
 </quote> 
 <quote> " He has asked that his privacy be respected. He will not be taking any media inquiries. It is at our request." </quote> 

Mr Morgan expressed his appreciation to The Sydney Morning Herald for assisting police.

Police knew where Wood was all along.

 <quote> "The SMH gave us valuable information in the days before his arrest," </quote>  he said.  <quote> "While not instrumental in locating him, it helped us expedite his arrest." </quote> 

When asked if there was a second suspect, Mr Morgan said:  <quote> "I am not making any comment about the evidence." </quote> 

When asked if he expected a second arrest, he said:  <quote> "Our concentration at the moment is on securing the extradition of Mr Wood." </quote>

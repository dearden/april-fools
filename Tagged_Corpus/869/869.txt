Get Top on the phone.

Apparently TIDAL is not only continuing to stockpile exclusives, but also announcing surprises releases too. On Twitter earlier tonight (April 4) TIDAL tweeted that fans can expect a  <quote> "new TDE release" </quote>  on the service tonight. Anthony  <quote> "Top Dawg" </quote>  Tiffith, the CEO of TDE, seemed to confirm that he'd be dropping something tonight, saying on Twitter,  <quote> "I will drop something when my plane touchdown in LA 2nite... kool?" </quote> 

It could be a multitude of things, but most people have it narrowed down to two artists - Isaiah Rashad or ScHoolboy Q. Snippets of Isaiah's new music have been popping up, including on Tiffith's Instagram, where he played a snippet from the studio while going through Rashad's album. ScHoolboy had a single previewed on Instagram recently, but no word of the full track has surfaced yet.

It could also be SZA, who hasn't dropped a solo project since 2014's Z. She's nonetheless seen her profile blossom between collaborations with D.R.A.M. and Rihanna while also singing on track four from Kendrick's untitled unmastered., so the timing feels right for a new release from the label's songstress.

TDE started the year off with a marketing stunt and a bang, as Tiffith posted a picture of a whiteboard with bogus statuses about each artist's new project. Kendrick ended up dropping a collection of pre- To Pimp a Butterfly tracks out of the clear blue sky, so it's not likely Kendrick is involved this go round.

What is most interesting about this is that Top Dawg Entertainment got their deal through Dre, so if Dre is Apple Music, what's TDE doing messing with TIDAL?

XXL has reached out to TIDAL for comment.

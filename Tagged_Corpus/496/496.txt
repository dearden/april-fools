Forget all the speculation as to the purpose of Stonehenge. After a detailed Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) study it appears Stonehenge's original purpose was to generate a focused vortex.

Coinciding with the summer solstice the heat from the sun on the longest day creates a vortex that originates from the inner ring of stones at Stonehenge and swirls upwards. At ground level it isn't obvious there is a vortex, but once you observe the air velocity above the highest stones there is a clear and powerful vortex.

CFD simulation reveals vertical extent of the vortex

There is still some uncertainty as to the purpose of such a vortex. Some say it is to aid the transition of ancient spirits to their afterlife. Others suggest that it is an ancient form of power generation long forgotten.

What is certain is that the exact shape and configuration of stones is no coincidence. This is a sophisticated vortex machine.

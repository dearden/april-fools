Shares of Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) made their much-anticipated debut this week, and the initial enthusiasm shows no signs of wearing off. The streaming music services large subscriber base has piqued the interest of a number of analysts and investors, including investment banking firm Stifel.

The firm has initiated coverage of Spotify with a buy rating and a price target of $180 per share. The firm's bullish stance on Spotify is bolstered by the streaming services' $9.99 per month price point, which it places right behind Netflix's subscription rate and what Amazon charges for Prime membership in terms of value for internet services on a per dollar basis.

For less than $10 per month, Spotify users can listen to all the music they want in on demand fashion. Stifel anticipates the service will gain even more traction in the coming years, and forecasts paying subscribers will grow to 159 million by 2021. The firm acknowledges that the on-demand music streaming segment is highly competitive, including offerings from Apple, Amazon, and Google, but feels that Spotify will be able to retain an edge due to its technology-driven personalization and scale.

As Stifel sees it, factors such as the company's market leadership, exposure to emerging markets, and favorable user demographics in the face of a vastly different entertainment landscape help to position the company for plenty of growth in the years ahead.

Spotify Technology S.A. shares rose $4.28 (+2.97%) in premarket trading Thursday. Year-to-date, SPOT has declined -3.21%, versus a -0.84% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

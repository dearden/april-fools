One chick whose style (and hair styles!) I really love is Kristen Stewart of Twilight fame.

She is always impeccably dressed, with her low-slung corduroys, knotted band t-shirts, dark chipped nail polish, silly bandz, and minimalist makeup.

Her classic style is topped off by lovely  <quote> "I'm too busy to sleep" </quote>  undereye circles (they're the next big thing--which I'm totally stoked about since I have them naturally and thus do not have to work for them) and tousled, carefree hair. Who needs a brush?

Ladies and gents, today's style icon: Kristen Stewart.

I only hope I can dress half as well as her someday!

BRB...gotta go throw away my brush.

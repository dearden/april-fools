Droptop versions of the Land Rover Evoque and Nissan Murano exist, so why not the Honda CR-V?

Yes, that really is a roofless Honda CR-V you're looking at. No, it's not the work of a talented render artist or a crazy contraption created by Top Gear or The Grand Tour – it's a new official model revealed by Honda. Presenting the Honda CR-V Roadster, based on the SUV's current platform and available only with a gasoline engine. It may sound like a crazy idea, but then again droptop versions of the Land Rover Evoque and Nissan Murano exist, so why not the Honda CR-V?

Available in showrooms from April 1, Honda's new topless SUV isn't technically a drop-top, since it doesn't feature a roof whatsoever according to Honda,  <quote> “making it a no-top rather than a drop-top” </quote> . To create the CR-V Roadster the PR team removed both the B and C pillars of the car using an angle grinder. Since buyers are only getting half a car, prices start from half the current price of the CR-V, making the new roadster variant a seriously good bargain for the budget-conscious consumer. The downside? Structural rigidity is said to have been reduced by 100 percent, rendering the car  <quote> “completely undriveable.” </quote> 

 <quote> “This is a bold new direction for the CR-V and opens up an entirely new non-existent market,” </quote>  said Eipurirufuru, Future Opportunity Occupational Lead.  <quote> “Our sales target is somewhat conservative to start with, at zero cars, but we are confident that once the minor glitches are ironed out, such as the lack of roof and the fact it is totally structurally unsound, the car will fly out of showrooms.” </quote>

The Blackpool Tower is to be moved to London today because London is a bit warmer than it is in Blackpool. There has not been a summer in Blackpool for years now,long hot sunny days are a thing of the past as Global Freezing continues to bite.

While the one sided media campaign continues to brainwash people with Global Warming propaganda, its clear that some people will believe in Global Warming even when they are surrounded by six feet of snow.

When they move the tower to London it will be interesting to see if they still call it Blackpool Tower because there already is a Tower of London.

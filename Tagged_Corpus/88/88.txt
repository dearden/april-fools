Just a day after firing Mexican legend Hugo Sanchez as head coach of the Mexican national team, the Mexican Football Federation has found his replacement and it is a familiar face to U.S. national team fans.

Former U.S. national team, D.C. United and Red Bulls coach Bruce Arena will be named the new head coach of the Mexican national team at a press conference in Mexico City on Tuesday. Arena will sign a contract that will run through the 2010 World Cup.

 <quote> "Obviously it is a great opportunity to coach one of the best teams in the world," </quote>  Arena said.  <quote> "I will have to learn some Spanish but I believe I'm the right man for this job." </quote> 

The surprising decision was made quickly on Monday evening, with Arena beating out Jose Pekerman for the position.

 <quote> "After Hugo Sanchez's tenure with the national team it was time for a new perspective, time for a coach with experience being successful with a national team," </quote>  Mexican federation president Justino Compean said.  <quote> "We also felt that we needed a more modest approach and a more understated coach." </quote>

Sydney man Jai Abberton admitted shooting alleged standover man Tony Hines three times in the head, but said the killing was to protect himself and his new girlfriend, a court heard today.

Abberton, 31, the brother of professional surfer Koby Abberton, has pleaded not guilty to the murder of Mr Hines, who the defendant's lawyers today described as a violent man.

Mr Hines, 37, was shot three times in the head and once in the hand at Maroubra, in Sydney's east, on August 5, 2003.

His body, naked except for one shoe, was found three days later at the base of a nearby cliff.

The NSW Supreme Court was told today there was no dispute that Abberton shot Mr Hines - the question was whether he acted in self-defence.

 <quote> "It is not unlawful to kill a man in self-defence," </quote>  defence barrister Graham Turnbull told the jury.

 <quote> "The victim in this case, the evidence will establish, was unique in his capacity to strike fear into anyone.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "I expect that the evidence will show that Anthony Gerard Hines was known widely - and in fact he encouraged this knowledge - as a violent man, a standover man and a rapist.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "That was the reputation which he promoted, in which he revelled, and which everybody was aware of." </quote> 

Mr Turnbull said  <quote> "the extent to which (Abberton) thought he was dealing with a rapist, a violent man, a standover man" </quote>  was therefore relevant to the defence case.

Crown Prosecutor John Kiely, SC, said Abberton and his girlfriend, known only as BC, had met up with Mr Hines at the Coogee Bay Hotel on the night of August 5.

When they left, Mr Hines followed them to BC's Nissan four-wheel drive and sat in the front passenger seat, with Abberton sitting in the back seat.

BC was expected to give evidence that as she drove through Maroubra, she heard a sound like a cap gun and saw Mr Hines bleeding from the mouth.

 <quote> "She also saw the accused sitting in the back seat holding a handgun," </quote>  Mr Kiely said.

Soon afterwards three shots left her ears ringing and she saw Mr Hines slumped in his seat.

BC later helped Abberton carry Mr Hines to the edge of a cliff, where Abberton rolled him over, the court was told.

Abberton allegedly told her:  <quote> "You've got to trust me. That guy's a rapist, a murderer, he's just a maggot. It was going to be me or him." </quote> 

Mr Kiely said Abberton later dumped BC's bloodstained four-wheel drive, which had a bullet hole in the windscreen, and disposed of the gun and their bloody clothes.

When police interviewed Abberton on August 18, he told them he  <quote> "did it for BC" </quote> , the court heard.

 <quote> "It will all come out at court. He was going to rape her" </quote>  he allegedly said.

 <quote> "I had to do it, he pulled out the gun and I got it off him and did it." </quote> 

Abberton had owed Mr Hines $200, the court was also told.

The trial, which is expected to last three to four weeks, continues tomorrow before Justice Terence Buddin.

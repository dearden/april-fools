Farmers near Shrewsbury claim to have witnessed sheep being  <quote> “lasered” </quote>  by unidentified light from UFOs.

They have linked the unexplained incidents, where sheep's brains and eyes were removed, to the mysterious orange lights in the sky.

They have found sheep with  <quote> “neat holes” </quote>  while their brains and other internal organs were removed. Other animals have lost eyes or had their flesh  <quote> “carefully stripped away” </quote> , usually on the left side.

Phil Hoyle, 53, who has spent almost a decade investigating how the livestock have died, said the UFOs were found to have roamed a 50-mile  <quote> "corridor" </quote>  between Shrewsbury and Powys.

Mr Hoyle and 15 members of the Animal Pathology Field Unit, claimed they witnessed UFOs at work last month while working during the night at a Welsh hill farm near Radnor Forest.

 <quote> “The technology involved in these attacks is frightening,” </quote>  he told The Sun.

 <quote> “These lights and spheres are clearly not ours.
 </quote> 
 <quote> “They are built by technology and intelligence that's not from here.” </quote> 

He added:  <quote> “For a short while it looked more like a Star Wars battle.” </quote> 

Next day he interviewed farmers and  <quote> "all but one had some type of unusual disappearance of animals or deaths with strange injuries" </quote> , he told the paper.

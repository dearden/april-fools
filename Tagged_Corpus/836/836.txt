A brewery has seen a spike in sales following a bizarre Twitter spat with politician George Galloway.

Matthew Halliday, owner of the Bradford Brewing Company said throngs of people have turned up at the brewery's Brewfactory bar in the wake of the online row.

The argument started after Mr Galloway, the Respect Party parliamentary candidate for Bradford West, West Yorkshire, appeared to take offence when the brewing firm asked him if he was  <quote> "still a thing?" </quote> .

Mr Galloway, who does not drink, was in combative mood when he responded to the beermakers.

@BradfordBrewery what does that mean? And should you as a licensed premises in my constituency really be writing that?

The brewer carefully reminded the politician he was no longer the MP for the area after parliament was dissolved last Monday.

However, Galloway did not let the matter lie and hit back with another tweet.

@BradfordBrewery well then, I shall return to this matter after the election. You have been most unwise — George Galloway (@georgegalloway) April 4, 2015

Mr Halliday, 29, said:  <quote> "It was a cheeky tweet that I sent while I walked past his office early in the morning that just seemed to have escalated.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "We are now completely blocked and anyone connected to us has been blocked. I only asked him because he is the only candidate standing here that hasn't been into the pub to say hello.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "But after this argument I don't think we will be seeing Team Galloway in here anytime soon." </quote> 

He added:  <quote> "We have seen a big boost in customers because of this. Almost everyone who came in yesterday did so because of Twitter." </quote>

However, Mr Halliday and his brewery are not the only people in Bradford to fall out of favour with the politician.

 <quote> "It is a running thing in Bradford to be blocked by George Galloway," </quote>  he said.  <quote> "It seems like half the city is blocked by him on Twitter." </quote> 

Mr Halliday said the spat has even sparked inspiration for a new brew, which the firm plans to name after the fiery Scot.

He said:  <quote> "We are planning to bring out a Galloway soon. I don't want to say too much as it is top secret right now, but all I can say is it is weak, bitter and has a frothy head." </quote>

The Twitter feud has been followed by people across the globe eager to see the small brewery take on the political heavyweight.

Mr Halliday added:  <quote> "We got one message from someone about to climb Kilimanjaro who said they wanted to postpone their ascent to follow the row online." </quote> 

A spokesman for Mr Galloway did not wish to comment on the row, saying:  <quote> "It certainly has put Bradford Brewery on the map." </quote>

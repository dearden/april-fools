In a move that almost seemed inevitable when the company purchased Lucasfilm for $4 billion in 2012, Disney recently announced that next year would mark the theatrical Star Wars debut for none other than Mickey Mouse.

Audiences will see classic Disney characters taking on popular roles from the recent blockbuster The Force Awakens in 2017's Star Wars: The Mouse Awakens. Mickey will portray the legendary Han Solo, while his beau Minnie acts as Leia Organa. Finn and Rey, newer names from the intergalactic franchise, will be played by Donald and Daisy Duck, respectively. Pete will don the robe and red lightsaber of Kylo Ren.

Costume SuperCenter was provided with the exclusive theatrical poster and three stills from the upcoming film, and you can see them below.

So, what do you think? Are you excited to see The Mouse Awakens? Or are you upset that Disney would turn something like Star Wars into a novelty? Either way, you can commemorate the moment with Star Wars and Disney costumes from Costume SuperCenter. If you combined them, though, you wouldn't be the first!

NOW ranked one of the top five literary festivals in the world, and with past attendance exceeding 80,000, the 2008 Sydney Writers' Festival is expanding its horizons.

This year its traditional centre by the harbour at Pier 4/5 in The Rocks will add its next-door neighbour, the disused wharf Pier 2/3, to accommodate the surge that flocks annually to one of Sydney's most spectacular successes.

Last night the festival's artistic director, Dr Wendy Were, announced her bumper program for this year, with 40 international guests and 136 locals signed up to take part in the 335 literary events scheduled across Sydney and from the Blue Mountains to Wollongong from May 19 to 25.

 <quote> "While there is no theme that guides this festival," </quote>  she said,  <quote> "I feel even so that it reflects the culture of today, one in which we now seem to be looking back at where we have been, sometimes anxiously, sometimes philosophically, yet also forward, trying to envision what lies ahead.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "So I guess there is some kind of coherency underlying the choices I have made. I think there is definitely a heightened sense of personal responsibility abroad at the moment and a sense that we also have a civic responsibility and I think all this is reflected in the program." </quote> 

Last year's Man Booker Prize winner, Anne Enright, heads the international contingent, which includes the award-winning biographers Hermione Lee and Simon Sebag Montefiore, the Scottish poet and memoirist John Burnside, the philosopher Simon Critchley, the Fulbright scholar and counter-terrorism expert Loretta Napoleoni, the poet and literary critic Blake Morrison and the comic novelist Julian Clary.

The novelist Jeanette Winterson, famed for her oratory and wit, will deliver the opening address and Junot Diaz, nominated by The New Yorker as one of the top 20 writers for the 21st century, will close the festival.

Surprisingly, the subject of death and dying has emerged as a continuing threnody throughout Were's programming. This is not deliberate, Were said, but an artefact of the kinds of books being published at the moment.

 <quote> "When I was putting the program together, I was astonished to discover just how many books were being published at this moment on the subject of death." </quote> 

Were said she was happy about what might be called  <quote> "the Pier 2/3 solution" </quote>  to the festival's growing numbers. It has been fitted out with a 450-seat venue downstairs and a 250-seat cabaret venue upstairs.

 <quote> "The whole area is such a beautiful precinct. People love coming to the festival because of it, I think. Now that we have Pier 2/3, I am happy to say we have no plans whatsoever to move the festival from its present site." </quote> 

■ Susan Wyndham writes: The Australian novelist Gail Jones is among eight writers shortlisted for the 2008 International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award for Dreams Of Speaking, about the friendship between an Australian woman and a Japanese man both fascinated by technology. With 100,000 ($170,000) prizemoney for the winner, the IMPAC is one of the world's richest literary awards. Another Australian, David Malouf, won the first award in 1996.

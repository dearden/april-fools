Ted Stebbins suffered brain damage in a 1986 car accident. With a largedose of humor, his brothers are helping him -- and others -- cope. NASHUA --  <quote> ''Ted's having a virgin pina colada," </quote>  says Ted's youngest brother, Tom. <quote> ''There's nothing virgin about Tom," </quote>  snorts the middle brother, Harrison. Ted emits a soundless laugh, eyes crinkled. He's sitting between his brothers, in his wheelchair, and the jokes and puns and insults fly from both sides. Ted soaks it up. The Stebbins brothers are at a table in Bertucci's to celebrate Ted's 36th birthday. It's comedy hour whenever the boys get together. It doesn't hurt that Harrison, the middle sibling, is a professional comedian. Last year, when Ted forgot Harrison's birthday, Harrison, 33, drove to the group home in Hillsborough, N.H., where Ted lives, unpacked his signs, and began picketing out in front.  <quote> ''God Forgives, I Don't," <quote>  read one sign.  <quote> ''March 29, Vote NO on Ted's Birthday," </quote>  said another. Inside the home, Ted cracked up, along with his caregivers. Regardless, this March 29 -- last Tuesday -- Harrison and Tom, 28, have driven up to Nashua bearing gifts and jibes. Harrison's got two tickets for him and Ted to see Ted's favorite rock group, U2. Tom and his wife, Johanna, have picked up some party novelties, including hats bearing an off-color birthday greeting. The brothers put a hat on Ted and then each don one themselves. To try to get the media to publicize an upcoming event in which Ted figures prominently, Tom, who works in public relations for WGBH, wrote a press release that described his family as  <quote> ''The Incredibles," </quote>  using their talents  <quote> ''to fight for the forces of good." </quote>  The occasion? The second annual  <quote> ''Laugh It Up" </quote>  benefit, happening this Wednesday, which will raise money to build homes for Massachusetts residents with head injuries. According to Tom Stebbins's news release, there's  <quote> ''The Chairman" </quote>  -- his father, T.L., head of investment banking for Adams Harkness Inc. He's the business brains behind the event. There's  <quote> ''The Accountress" </quote>  -- mom Lucinda, who, when not doing the family tax returns and working at her tax consulting job, keeps the books for Laugh It Up. There's  <quote> ''The Funnyman" </quote>  -- Harrison, who has corralled all his comic friends and talked the Comedy Connection into giving free space for the event, which he will MC. Then there's  <quote> ''The Marketeer" </quote>  -- Tom, the baby of the family, who  <quote> ''keeps the spin positive." </quote>  At the center of the story is  <quote> ''Captain Courage," who  <quote> ''uses his staggering powers of courage and charisma to keep the team together." </quote>  That would be Ted. Finding a home

On Jan. 6, 1986, Ted's father picked Ted up from a friend's house in Andover, following a ski outing. It was Sunday, midday, and they were headed back to their home in Wellesley. On Route 125, the car skidded on black ice, spun into the oncoming lane, and was struck by an oncoming car. Ted's father suffered broken ribs, and Ted had to be pried from the car by the Jaws of Life. He was taken by helicopter to Beth Israel in Boston, where he remained in a coma for three months. Seconds before the crash, Ted, who was a 16-year-old junior at Belmont Hill School, told his father he had decided to apply to Harvard, Princeton, and Stanford. It was the last conversation T.L. Stebbins would have with his son. Instead of going to a university, Ted Stebbins spent a year in a rehabilitation center, suffering from traumatic brain injury. He enrolled in the Massachusetts Hospital School for the physically disabled in Canton and stayed there until he was 22. (His mother now serves on its board.) Then the Stebbins family set about trying to find a place for a young man with a brain injury. They ended up at Robin Hill in Hillsborough, where Ted, who uses a wheelchair and is largely nonverbal, gets skilled care.  <quote> ''Ted is in New Hampshire because we couldn't find a facility in Massachusetts," </quote>  says his mother.  <quote> ''Housing is a huge problem for all these people who are brain injured. Nursing homes are not appropriate, because they're for elderly people. The state has some facilities for the mentally retarded, but people who are brain injured are a different population with different needs." </quote>  Several years ago, the Stebbins family became involved with Supportive Living Inc., a Woburn-based nonprofit whose mission is to provide housing for survivors of brain injuries. T.L. is a board member of the group, which has opened homes in North Reading and Woburn. They are raising money for a third home in Lexington, where they hope Ted will live someday. Already, there is a waiting list of 160. According to the Brain Injury Association of America, a million people are admitted to hospitals each year for brain trauma -- more than 50,000 die and more than 80,000 suffer lifelong disabilities. The Stebbins family hopes to raise $30,000 from this year's Laugh It Up, which will feature some of Boston's top comedians, including Tony V, Jimmy Dunn, Kelly MacFarland, Frank Santorelli, Jon Fisch, Paul Nardizzi, and, of course, Harrison Stebbins. Ted will be in his wheelchair in the front row, just like he was last year. And just like he was last year, he will be the butt of many of his brother's jokes.  <quote> ''You should have seen the audience's faces when I jumped onto Ted's wheelchair last year," </quote>  Harrison says.  <quote> ''They didn't know he was my brother, and here I was sitting on his lap." </quote>  Ted's propensity for free stuff was a running joke last year.  <quote> ''If you take Ted into the supermarket, he loves the free samples," </quote>  says Harrison, who told the crowd that after returning home from a family trip he found the hotel's remote control and Bible in Ted's bag.  <quote> ''We had to mail it back," </quote>  he said. Staying close

At Bertucci's, Ted feeds himself slowly with his left hand; his left side was less damaged than his right. Several times during dinner, Harrison and Tom stand and assist their brother, who has slid down in his wheelchair a bit.  <quote> ''You comfortable, buddy?" </quote>  Harrison asks from time to time. But mostly the brothers kid Ted, who responds with grins and a slurred  <quote> ''No comment" </quote>  when asked if he thinks his brothers are funny. A couple of times a month, Ted goes home to visit his parents, who still live in Wellesley; his brothers stop by to visit and help. Sometimes they meet at Bertucci's or at the movies, Ted driven by an aide at Robin Hill. Harrison was 14 and Tom 9 when their brother was injured. Both say they have made it their mission to keep up Ted's spirits. In fact, Harrison says he became a comic in part because of Ted.  <quote> ''Nothing rattles me onstage, nothing," </quote>  he says. As for Tom, he worked at Club Med for a while as  <quote> ''a jester," </quote>  the guy who gets the crowd laughing.  <quote> ''Both of us have been influenced by trying to keep Ted laughing," <quote>  Tom says. Their parents are proud of their sons' close ties.  <quote> ''They get along terrifically," </quote>  says Lucinda.  <quote> ''I really think they have stayed close to Boston so they could be close to their brother and be there for him, and help us out." </quote>  As for Ted, who played sports, made good grades, and was a computer geek, his mother says he was a laid-back, happy boy who, despite the trauma, has become a laid-back, happy adult.  <quote> ''It doesn't mean things are easy for him, or for any of us, but he's got an incredible sense of humor for someone who has been through what he's been through," </quote>  she says. Ted's going to need that sense of humor Wednesday night, when his brother will once again roast him. But it's only because Harrison is jealous, as he told the crowd last year: Ted has a girlfriend -- he's been seeing someone in the group home for nine years -- and Harrison doesn't.  <quote> ''He's the one who should be having a fund-raiser for me," </quote>  groused Harrison.

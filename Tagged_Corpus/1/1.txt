Matt Drudge later today will report that a man and woman dated, sources tell The Register.

An intern on the fringe of the John Kerry campaign once dated Kerry's Finance Director Peter Maroney. When pushed by The Register, top sources within the Kerry machine confirmed the shocking news that the two staff members enjoyed dinners and possibly even drinks over the course of two months. This bizarre hetrosexual courting ritual could destroy Senator Kerry's bid for the White House, according to Kerry's rivals.

Rumors about the controversial dating first reported by the Drudge Report ignited a behind-the-scenes campaign drama in which reporters tried to uncover what the couple liked to eat for dinner. The intern - Alex Polier - is said to have a flirtatious manner when eating steak and cabbage.

At present, it's unclear whether other members of Kerry's staff date, but, if they do, you'll read about it first in this space.

Attorney General John Ashcroft provided the official White House comment on the alleged dating.

It's unclear how these revelations will affect the Kerry campaign.

CAMPAIGNERS are calling for the names of some of Wales' most historic towns, cities and villages to be changed in tribute to hit musical Mamma Mia!

Aberystwyth, Abergavenny and Aberdare are among the places which would cease to exist as we know them, if a new pressure group succeeds with its ambitious plans.

Campaigners want to replace the Celtic prefix  <quote> “Aber” </quote>  with  <quote> “Abba” </quote>  in more than 60 of Wales' towns, cities and villages before the popular musical, featuring the songs of Swedish supergroup Abba, opens at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff in November.

It means that university town Aberystwyth would be known as Abbaystwyth, Abergavenny would become Abbagavenny and Aberdare would be transformed into Abbadare.

In the village of Abertridwr, near Caerphilly, the group, ANA, which stands for Abba Not Aber, has already tried out a modified sign.

Mamma Mia!, which will be at the Wales Millennium Centre for 10 weeks, has broken previous box office records at the Cardiff Bay venue, with tickets selling out faster than for any other show.

ANA members have now taken to the streets with their campaign in a bid to get local support.

Mary Jones, a member of ANA who lives in Abertridwr, said:  <quote> “Wales is full of places that begin with ‘Aber' and is renowned across the world for being a land of song.
 </quote> 
 <quote> “It is entirely fitting that, on April 1, we replace the prefix ‘Aber' with ‘Abba' to show our appreciation of the wonderful music that is the basis of the Mamma Mia! musical.” </quote> 

A spokesman for the Wales Millennium Centre said:  <quote> “Tickets for Mamma Mia! have sold quicker than any other show that we've had here so far. Mamma Mia! mania has certainly hit Wales.” </quote> 

Mamma Mia! is at the Wales Millennium Centre from November 16 to January 23. The box office number is 029 2063 6464.

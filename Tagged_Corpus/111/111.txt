Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon updated his personal website, noob.com with a variety of things. But most importantly, the coded message of TOUCH seems to carry a little more weight than everything else on the site. We investigated the TOUCH word with our sources and unearthed a shocking revelation. Midway is working on bringing the Mortal Kombat universe to Apple's iPhone / iPod Touch platform. Apple recently announced plans to allow developers to create their own native applications for the iPhone / iPod Touch and several game companies, including EA and Sega, are developing games for the powerful platform. We asked our sources about the TOUCH message on Boon's website and revealed to us that indeed Midway is also going to capitalize on the booming iPhone install base.

Since the message was already leaked by Boon on his website, our source was able to provide us this exclusive video of a prototype build of Mortal Kombat Touch.

As you can see, the game uses the iPhone's tilt sensing capability to move your character around the screen. Along the perimeter of the screen are the attack buttons and touching anywhere but in the corners is the block button. While the video clip features the Dead Pool stage and Kitana from Mortal Kombat 2 the opponent is Kabal from MK3/UMK3. This could mean that we could see a version of Mortal Kombat Trilogy being ported over to the iPhone.

While this is quite the revelation, this doesn't have anything to do with the  <quote> "Mortal Kombat 8" </quote> , the next-generation re-visioning of the Mortal Kombat franchise. In a few more weeks on April 17 all will be revealed at Midway's Gamers Day in Las Vegas. In the meantime, check out a better screenshot of the game's launch icon on the iPhone's springboard on our temporary Mortal Kombat Touch GameRealm.

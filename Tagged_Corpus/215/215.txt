In a stunning move just two days before the iPad launches into the US market, to be followed within the month to other countries, Steve Jobs will announce later today that the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad OS 4.0 will be released - with multitasking.

I knew it! There always had to be 'one more thing' when it came to the iPad, and iTWire has learned of an Apple announcement due at 11.50am this morning from Cupertino of a stunning new development with Apple's amazing range of iDevices.

Set to silence critics who have claimed forever that the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPhone OS 4.0 lacked multitasking, Apple's super-CEO and mega iChief, Steve Jobs is set to announce later today the long awaited new iOS 4.0 - with multitasking as one of its headline features.

People very familiar with the matter, thus wanting confidentiality, and mindful of not only the day of this announcement, but also of incurring the wrath of Steve Jobs, have nevertheless been able to let slip that the new OS will feature an incredible, magical and revolutionary new way to multitask applications on the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad using Apple's superlative multitouch capabilities.

While precise details of the ultra-intuitive multitasking method are still under wraps in preparation for reality field distortionment via Steve Jobs himself, iTWire has learned that the new multitasking method is an 'A+ update' over the way that multitasking has been done on PCs and competing smartphones.

Speculation has also emerged over whether yet another 'one more thing' will be announced at today's press conference, which is details of an iPad camera being included after all, kept as a special surprise designed to thrill and delight consumers, cement Steve Jobs place in the pantheon of greatest CEOs of all time, and send Apple's shares soaring past Google's to US $600 per share.

iTWire has also learned that, while the new OS 4.0 is being announced today, with an updated SDK and OS 4.0 user download to come by the end of the month, even more cool features will only be usable in the upcoming iPhone 4.0 hardware and iPod Touch 4th generation, although multitasking will be possible on existing iPhone and iPod Touch hardware - and of course the brand new iPad itself.

Apple's iPhone 4.0 and OS 4.0, which have also been branded 'A+' updates by Steve Jobs himself, are heavily expected to totally outclass the current Google Android platform, making the Google Nexus One, the HTC Desire, the Nokia N900 and also Microsoft's upcoming Windows Phone 7 Series devices look like ancient Commodore 64 computers from the 80s by comparison.

With Apple truly now the digitally inspired device maker of the 21st century, and with true multitasking now arriving on Apple's most celebrated mobile platform, Steve Jobs has thrown his latest gauntlet at the rest of the mobile industry and is clearly daring them to put up, shut up and catch up.

We look forward, as no doubt does everyone, to Steve Jobs' special announcement at 11.50am today, this first glorious day of April, a day that will surely go down in history, on this stunning and incredible new development for the iPhone, the iPod Touch and the world's most magical and revolutionary tablet computer device ever, the iPad.

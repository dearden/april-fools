Not that long ago, Trampt co-owner Keegan put forth a battle cry, requesting fans to  <quote> "Follow" </quote>  his Trampt profile so that it could surpass Huck Gee's profile in numbers. And now, it has done just that; at the time of this writing, Keegan has 107 Followers versus Gee's paltry 98. We're told by a reliable insider — a man that once held hands with Gee's 2nd cousin twice removed back in grade school — that Gee is furious over this… to the point that he's declared war on the site.
He's rallying his vast legion of fans together to descend, as one, upon Trampt and overwhelm Keegan by Following Gee. But we're told from the same source that this request isn't being made without a reward potential: When Gee hits one million Followers on the website, he'll pick one at random to give a free custom to! Amazing! So go forth, my little Gee heads, open a Trampt account and start Following the King!

Blur bassist Alex James has confirmed the band have regrouped – to write a  <quote> “dirty, nasty, filthy” </quote>  new album.

The bassist told XFM that despite singer Damon Albarn's recent massive success with Gorillaz, he's found time to regroup his old band to make their first LP since 2003's ‘Think Tank'.

James said:  <quote> “We all got together before Christmas. Damon, Dave (Rowntree, drummer) and I and were making the most nasty, dirty, filthy rock music I think we've ever made…it was great.” </quote> 

He added:  <quote> “And then Damon's been making his records, I've been busy with (new band) Wigwam and Dave's got this multi-media empire going on, but I think there's plans to reconvene really soon, I think probably towards the end of the year.” </quote> 

James reckons that the noisy, aggressive music they've been working on may well set the tone for the whole new album.

He confirmed:  <quote> “It seems to be going like that. I mean, you never know what a record's gonna sound like till you've finished recording it, but it was sounding that way.

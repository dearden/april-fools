This morning embargoed news of Wrexham Council's audacious move to declare Wrexham as the Capital City of Wales, usurping Cardiff, was revealed to an early morning press conference. A spokesman said  <quote> “Wrexham lost out in its recent bid for city status to St Asaph, so we had been working on this Plan B“. </quote> 
In a brief presentation those present were told Wrexham was incorporated as a town in 1857 and the legal documentation for that process has been seen by modern day legal experts who concluded that they can exercise an option to claim capital city status. The process was last visited in 1955, when Cardiff was formally recognised as the capital, when Minister for Welsh Affairs Gwilym Lloyd-George commented in a Parliamentary written answer that  <quote> “no formal measures are necessary to give effect to this decision“. </quote> 

The rules date back to the early 1800's regarding the moving around of the title, and the mayoral powers that go with it. Although these powers are very much ceremonial in the modern era, the title of ‘Capital City' of the country of Wales is still seen as important.

Speaking to Wrexham.com this morning a spokesman said  <quote> “We expect the people of Wrexham will wake up happier than ever, there have been a few capital cities of Wales including Pontrhydfendigaid, Machynlleth and even Ludlow in 1473 when it was under the ancient ‘Council of Wales and the Marches', legally speaking we are on solid ground and although we wont be a city, we shall be the capital city.” </quote> 

The Special Prefectory Office Of Fiefdoms, the Parlimentary office who deals with these affairs have commented saying  <quote> “we recognise the claim from Wrexham however are obliged to give Cardiff a period of time to get in touch so do not wish to comment further.” </quote> 

Paul Rank, from the consulting company employed by Wrexham Council, said  <quote> “We are very very excited as this is the first time in several hundred years for such a thing to happen, and we think this is the first time in the world such a change has occured.” </quote>

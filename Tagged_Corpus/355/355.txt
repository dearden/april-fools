Imagine having children with any of the One Direction boys. Zayn will teach your kids poetry and riddles while Niall teaches them guitar. Louis and Harry will obviously have expressive, dramatic kids. Liam? Liam will be the sweetest father who teaches your kids how to get all the solos. It's too bad they're living in a continent far far away.

Well…were you already saying goodbye to your hopes and dreams of getting married to them? Well girls (and boys), you better start dreaming again….


ONE DIRECTION IS COMING TO SOUTHEAST ASIA!!!

When you're an indie developer, you've got to do something to stand out, and we learned today about someone who's doing their best in that department. Kairosoft found themselves with quite a hit on their hands last year when they debuted Game Dev Story for iOS devices, a game that put players in control of an imaginary game development studio. Today, Kairosoft has announced that their first game will be titled Video Game Reviewer: The RPG. In this game, players step into the shoes of a video game journalist and make their way from a lonely page on Blogspot to the heights of full-time paid reviewing.

When the game begins, players write reviews of any amazing (or amazingly terrible) game they choose, but as they gain Facebook Likes and blog comments, they earn XP, level up, and gain skills such as Epic Smackdown and Missed Potential, which allow them to complete more difficult reviews (such as the dreaded  <quote> "really fun game with too many problems to receive a good score" </quote> ). Those who want to focus more on defense won't be left out either â€“ they can select skills like Fanboy Crusher, which increases defense against flame attacks, and Ad Homo-nem, which instantly KOs any enemy whose attack questions the player's sexual orientation.

With the runaway success of last year's Game Dev Story on iOS, this could be the next logical step for metagaming. Stay tuned for a review, as this subject is obviously near and dear to our hearts.

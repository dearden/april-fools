The river city's elected officials will never consider introducing tolls for Brisbane's pedestrian bridges, if our April Fools' Day story is any guide. Unsurprisingly, many readers reacted with outrage to the 'proposal', with more then 90 per cent of poll respondents rejecting the idea.

The report reveals departmental officials have had one meeting with TransLink to discuss the feasibility of charging the tolls via the Go Card system.

One sticking point is that the proposed touch-on and touch-off points are both within the one ticketing zone, meaning the fare could be wiped if people touch off within the 20-minute  <quote> "cancel journey" </quote>  window.

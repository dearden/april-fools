MANILA, Philippines - Anne Curtis might have to stay a little longer at the hospital for her to recover from a box jellyfish sting early Thursday morning (one o'clock) in San Juan, Batangas, while shooting a scene for the ABS-CBN show Dyesebel.

Obviously, the box jellyfish didn't recognize Anne as a â€˜colleague' even if she was in her half-fish form.

The sting was poisonous. As soon as Anne felt the possibly lethal bite on the left side of her body (inset), she screamed in pain and started vomitting as her legs went numb. She was rushed to a nearby provincial hospital in San Juan before 2 a.m. and transferred to another hospital in Lipa City before brought on an ambulance at 4 a.m. to St. Luke's Global City where she's recovering.

According to Kuya Kim Atienza, the box jellyfish is one of the deadliest sea creatures. Its poison can hit the heart, the nervous system and the skin cells.

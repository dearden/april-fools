I can't believe I'm reporting this, but Britney Spears passed away today at the age of 26 after being found unresponsive in a washroom of the LA hot spot NABU. An autopsy has not yet been performed, but it is believed that she was under the influence of a prescription drug and may have overdosed on an injectable street drug.


Britney is best known for her studio albums, music videos, and songs such as  <quote> "...Baby One More Time" </quote> , Oops!...I Did It Again, I'm a Slave 4 U and the Grammy Award Winning  <quote> "Toxic" </quote> . In the early 2000s, Spears's success as a singer led her way to high-profile deals and endorsements, as well as forays into other forms of media, including film and reality TV. Her third and fourth albums, Britney and In the Zone, were released during this era. In 2004 she married dancer and aspiring rap artist Kevin Federline.


Details surrounding her death are still being released by LA coroner's office. Please stay tuned.

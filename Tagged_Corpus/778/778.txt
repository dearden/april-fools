Sports information company Opta Sportsdata, based in Waterloo Road, has won an award for its success in generating business in overseas markets.

Opta Sportsdata specialises in the collection, analysis and delivery of sports information. The firm has won the Outstanding Service Company category in the 2007 Passport to Export London Awards..

The awards recognise the successes of small and medium-sized businesses in trading overseas under UK Trade & Investment's Passport to Export programme of advice and support for new and inexperienced exporters.

The winners in five categories were announced at a ceremony hosted by broadcaster and comedian Sandi Toksvig in Westminster last week.

Opta, based in the Capital Tower (formerly home to 3i), beat off competition from four other finalists to win its award category.

Health and safety killjoys targeted Punch and Judy man Glyn Edwards to tell him his famously feisty puppets could not hold sticks.

The 68-year-old claimed bureaucrats told him the toy truncheon might offend the  <quote> “vulnerable” </quote> .

So the veteran entertainer has made tiny hi-viz jackets for his puppets, mocking the pedantic penpushers.

 <quote> “I had a request saying, ‘Could Mr Punch please make sure his stick is not used because he has a duty of care to the vulnerable',” </quote>  Glyn said.

 <quote> “They were trying to tell me, ‘We don't want you doing this activity so we have come up with this.'” </quote> 

First he created a  <quote> “Mr Jobsworth” </quote>  character who would meet his end being pushed through Mr Punch's sausage machine.

His fluorescent vest would produce a string of  <quote> “hi-viz sausages” </quote> .

 <quote> “Then I thought, ‘Actually, I could have two puppets.” </quote>  Glyn said.

 <quote> “Mr Punch has a warm up because you don't want to start right away.
 </quote> 
 <quote> “So I came up with two health and safety officers who try and make everything safe.” </quote> 

Glyn, whose dad is from Gabalfa, Cardiff, jokes that among the requests from various officials over the years he has even been asked to make sure the sun is not too hot.

 <quote> “I have had specific requests asking me, ‘Would I please ensure that children are not sat in the sun without their parents being aware,” </quote>  he said.

 <quote> “You are meant to put up a sign or make an announcement.
 </quote> 
 <quote> “I have had to put mats down so the stones don't get too hot in the sun in case children were hurt.” </quote> 

Glyn, who runs Original World Famous Brighton Punch and Judy Show and has also appeared at Aberystwyth's annual Punch and Judy festival, says he has also been told check beach pebbles are not sharp.

 <quote> “It's a public beach!” </quote>  he said.  <quote> “Does anyone else have to do this?
 </quote> 
 <quote> “Then there is the thing, if it is very windy there could be a danger of the whole stage blowing over, therefore I am asked to tie it down.
 </quote> 
 <quote> “Then the ropes become a trip hazard!” </quote> 

A pal of his was told to put up a sign warning about the risky ropes.

 <quote> “The wind blew that off, it hit a kid in the face and cut his cheek,” </quote>  said Glyn, who is organising The Big Grin to celebrate Punch's 350th  <quote> “birthday” </quote>  this year.

 <quote> “It is like when they mop the floor and put up a notice saying, ‘Danger wet floor,' and then you trip over the notice.
 </quote> 
 <quote> “It causes more low level injuries than it stops.
 </quote> 
 <quote> “And it is all driven by the compensation culture.” </quote> 

He urged government officials to see sense.

 <quote> “People are broke, the bankers have run off with our cash and we have not got time for this,” </quote>  he said.

 <quote> “We need to go back to basics in some way, now that political correctness has moved on.
 </quote> 
 <quote> “We have asked what is and is not important. Certain things are. And certain things are not.” </quote> 

Glyn thought the  <quote> “mad political correctness of the ‘80s and ‘90s” </quote>  was gone.

 <quote> “And I think the same will happen with health and safety,” </quote>  he said.

 <quote> “Mr Punch has lived through Regency times, Victorian times, Edwardian times, the depression, the ‘50s, the Swinging ‘60s and the Thatcher years.
 </quote> 
 <quote> “From Mr Punch's perspective things are ever changing.” </quote> 

He still feared for the future.

 <quote> “I have been performing Punch and Judy for 50 years,” </quote>  he said.

 <quote> “Given that Mr Punch, in the 350 years he has been around, has never been at the centre of any significant health and safety issue, you do look at them and go, ‘This is what the 21st century is all about.'” </quote>

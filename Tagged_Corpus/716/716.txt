He got two thumbs up.

Roger Ebert, who became the most popular and powerful movie critic in the world by the simple trick of also making himself a TV star, died Thursday after a 10-year battle with thyroid cancer.

He was 70.

The cancer robbed him of his physical voice, but it never silenced the razor-sharp commentary that won him a Pulitzer Prize and near-universal admiration.

In addition to getting the first Pulitzer for a movie critic, he was also the first film commentator to be given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

 <quote> "The movies won't be the same without Roger." </quote> 

Robert Redford called Ebert  <quote> "one of the great champions of freedom of artistic expression." </quote> 

 <quote> "When the power of independent film was still unknown and few would support it, Roger was there for our artists." </quote>  he said.  <quote> "His personal passion for cinema was boundless, and that is sure to be his legacy for generations to come." </quote> 

A prolific writer widely admired for his even-handed criticism, Ebert worked in Hollywood himself for a time, most notably co-writing the 1970 Russ Meyer film,  <quote> "Beyond the Valley of the Dolls." </quote> 

He and Meyer collaborated on several projects, including an ill-fated Sex Pistols project, but  <quote> "Beyond the Valley" </quote>  was their best known, a classic Meyer exercise in glorious unapologetic excess.

Ebert began reviewing films for the Chicago Sun-Times in 1967. In 1975 he teamed up with his Chicago Tribune counterpart and rival, Gene Siskel, to talk and argue about movies on a Chicago public television show called  <quote> "Sneak Previews." </quote> 

The two men both said they began as competitors rather than friends, but they had an on-screen chemistry aided by the fact neither came across as a slick professional performer.

In 1978 PBS put the show into national syndication, and their shorthand  <quote> "thumbs up" </quote>  or  <quote> "thumbs down" </quote>  review system became a national catchphrase well beyond movie reviews.

Sensing the show had potential beyond the modest rewards of PBS, the two took their hot property into commercial syndication in 1982 as  <quote> "Siskel and Ebert at the Movies." </quote>  They also trademarked the phrase  <quote> "Two Thumbs Up." </quote> 

The show became  <quote> "At the Movies with Siskel and Ebert" </quote>  when it jumped to Disney in 1986. It continued there until Siskel died in 1999 of a brain tumor at the age of 53.

Ebert rejected suggestions for a rotating cohost after Siskel's death and chose his Sun-Times colleague Richard Roeper. Their show continued until 2008, though Ebert's cancer kept him off the air for many of the later years.

Beyond the  <quote> "thumbs up" </quote>  catchphrase,  <quote> "Siskel and Ebert" </quote>  spawned dozens or hundreds of similar shows in which critics discussed movies, music, TV shows or other matters of contemporary popular culture.

Ebert was best known for the TV show, but he continued writing for the Sun-Times. And though he was a blogger, he often argued that old media still had a critical and valuable place in popular culture discussion.

He was a star among Chicago journalists, often holding court on a wide range of subjects at local watering holes. He was a friend of Oprah Winfrey, whom he once dated, and he was among those urged her to put her Chicago TV show into syndication.

He also found time to write a dozen books, on subjects ranging from walking tours of London to Martin Scorsese to a history of the University of Illinois. His snappiest title was  <quote> "The Computer Insectiary: A Field Guide to Viruses, Bugs, Worms, Trojan Horses and Other Stuff That Will Eat Your Programs and Rot Your Brain." </quote>

He published annual guides to the best movies of each year, as well as broader anthologies that served as reference books. He said, however, that he considered the definitive movie reference to be the books by his friend Leonard Maltin.

Born in Urbana, Ill., Ebert gravitated early to journalism, writing critiques and articles for the sci-fi fanzines of the 1950s.

He said several times in later life that his greatest influence was Mad magazine, which he said taught him to look behind the mask at what the player was really doing or saying.

He graduated from the University of Illinois in 1964. He was attending graduate school at the University of Chicago when he landed the Sun-Times movie critic job and left school to write full-time.

He returned to the U of I often over the years as a lecturer. In 1999 he began producing an annual event there called the  <quote> "Overlooked Film Festival." </quote>

He also started the annual movie gathering  <quote> "Ebertfest" </quote>  in Champaign.

He suffered from alcoholism in his early years, and said he quit drinking for good in 1979 after joining Alcoholics Anonymous. He would occasionally blog on the subject.

A bachelor for many years, he married trial attorney Chaz Hammelsmith in 1992.

After he was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2002, the disease spread to his lower right jaw and part of his mandible was removed, leaving him unable to speak.

He said he was just happy he could continue to work.

 <quote> "I was told photos of me in this condition would attract the gossip papers," </quote>  he wrote.  <quote> "So what? ... I still have my brain and my typing fingers. Being sick is no fun. But you can have fun while you're sick." </quote> 

He subsequently investigated and underwent several procedures designed to help restore his speech. None were successful and he switched to a computerized voice system.

He is survived by his wife and his right thumb.

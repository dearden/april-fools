Farmer David Graham's stepping out big time, writes Tim Hunter.

DAVID GRAHAM, the Big Brother housemate who became an overnight role model for gay men in rural Australia when he outed himself on national television, is as ecstatic as he is surprised that he remains in contention on Dancing with the Stars.

While there is a sense that the possession of two left feet may mean Graham's charmed existence in the Dancing spotlight will come to a close next week, he is more optimistic.

 <quote> "I've got another two weeks to nail the dances for the next show. I obviously need more time than the other contestants, and need to work harder, but I'm over the moon," </quote>  he said last week.

 <quote> "I'm in for another week. Every week we stay, I wake up the next morning and ring Eliza, my dance partner, just to make sure that I didn't make it up." </quote> 

With his big smile and sunny, on-screen personality, Graham is the surprise survivor of this season of Dancing. He has become something of a phenomenon.

Cafes in Prahran, in Melbourne's gay heartland, display  <quote> "vote for David" </quote>  posters advertising the SMS number fans need to use to keep him on the show. But it's not just gay supporters who are on side.

 <quote> "I did an interview on radio this morning," </quote>  he said.  <quote> "And they said it was the 'Gs' that were voting for me: the graziers, the grain-growers, the gays and the grannies." </quote> 

Hailing from another G, Goondiwindi in Queensland where he manages his family's drought-stricken 18,000-hectare property, Graham's awkward efforts are attracting a lot of rural support, and he is returning the favour; his nominated charity for funds raised through the SMS voting system is Bush Connection, an agency that helps rural families.

With him having been cast as a wildcard character on both Dancing and Big Brother, television executives might want to think about other projects for Graham. His audience appeal is proving to be pretty broad.

 <quote> "I think with Big Brother, it was the middle-aged females that were voting for me, but these days, I'm getting cheers from schoolchildren and old ladies," </quote>  Graham says.  <quote> "I really appreciate them coming on the journey with me, because it is a journey, and I'm getting better and stronger all the time." </quote> 

But it's not all glamour and sequins. Speaking the morning after a live show in which he performed the paso doble, and achieved the lowest score Dancing has recorded, he's a little less chipper.

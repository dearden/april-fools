Few videogame properties hold the cachet of The Legend of Zelda. As a film project, it's on the scale of Lord of the Rings. But no one has tackled a live-action adaptation of the storied franchise… until today. Production Company Rainfall Films has asked IGN to premiere the very first footage from their live-action Zelda film — a very literal adaptation of the magical epic — and, of course, we said,  <quote> "Yes!" </quote> 

Much like the indie gem Cloverfield, this project has been shrouded in secrecy and details kept close to the vest. What we do know is that the film is being written and directed by newcomer Sam Balcomb. Going the route of Star Wars: Episode IV, this production decided to cast all unknowns in the iconic roles. Link is played by JR Killigrew, Camille C. Brown portrays a very Elven Princess Zelda, and Gregory Lee Kenyon stars as Ganondorf. You may, however, recognize Camden Toy (see TV's Buffy and Angel) in the supporting role as Sahasrahla.

Be sure to watch the debut trailer here.

We'll have more about this project as details surface, but for now, gaze upon the first footage of this amazing undertaking. And when you're through with that, revisit our Legend of Zelda  <quote> "casting call" </quote>  story from 2006 to see just how far off we were with our picks.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, be sure to chime in with your thoughts on the flick below!

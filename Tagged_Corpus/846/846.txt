Naomi Klein is publishing a book with Allen Lane to explain Donald Trump's rise to power as  <quote> "a product of our time" </quote>  and exploring what can be done to resist his brand of shock politics.

No is Not Enough will publish on 13th June 2017, making it one of the fastest books to publish in response to Trump's presidency, the publisher said. In it, the No Logo author will turn her lens on Trump's ascension as  <quote> "a corporate takeover" </quote>  and provide what Penguin Press describes as  <quote> "a bitingly sharp toolkit for understanding and resisting Trump's shock politics" </quote> .

 <quote> "Trump, extreme as he is," </quote>  Klein argued,  <quote> "is not an aberration but the logical extension of the worst and most dangerous trends of the past half-century. He is the personification of the merger of humans and corporations – a one-man megabrand with wife and children as spin-off brands.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "This book helps us understand how we arrived at this surreal place, how to stop it getting a lot worse, and how, if we keep our heads, we can seize the opportunity to make things a whole lot better in a time of urgent need. A toolkit for shock-resistance." </quote> 

Klein is the author of books, No Logo, The Shock Doctrine and This Changes Everything, centred on globalisation, and No is Not Enough has accordingly been pitched as  <quote> "the global agenda-setting analysis of this era" </quote> .

In it, she will not only expose the forces behind Trump's success - referring to the president as  <quote> "reality TV branding, celebrity obsession and CEO-worship, Vegas and Guantanamo, fake news and vulture bankers all rolled into one" </quote>  in Penguin Press' press release - she will also offer a plan of action to help build a fairer society and more sustainable world.

No Is Not Enough will be published simultaneously worldwide on 13th June 2017: in the UK by Allen Lane, priced £12.99; in Canada by Knopf, an imprint of Penguin Random House Canada, and in the US by the independent non-profit publisher Haymarket Books. Klein will be in the UK at the end of June and early July to promote.

Other quick-off-the-mark projects to follow Trump's US presidential victory include fellow Penguin Random House author Howard Jacobson's retort, a  <quote> "ferociously funny" </quote>  fairy tale for grown-ups called Pussy, publishing with Jonathan Cape in January, while various non-fiction projects on post-truth have also emerged, the latest of which is BBC  <quote> "Newsnight" </quote>  presenter and broadcaster Evan Davis' book Post Truth, subtitled Why We Have Reached Peak Bullshit and What We Can Do About It, publishing with Little, Brown.

It appears that the level is mostly the same structure but with a darker theme with the castle music. In addition, there are significantly more enemies to be found. There is a mixture of enemies that are not usually found in the same area, for example Koopas, Mecha-koopas, Goombas, Boos, Dry Bones, and even a Cheep-cheep and Blooper are all here!

Yoshi egg in the  <quote> "dark" </quote>  version, but not in the original. Perhaps Yoshi appears in more levels compared to the regular NSMBW?

At least there are no surprises at the ending flag.

The secret remake of NSMBW can be unlocked by playing through the original game and collecting every single star coin in the game, followed by entering a sequence at the startup screen.

The reported key sequence:
Rotate the nunchuk control stick counterclockwise 16 times and continue to hold in that direction, press B, then press A, and finally press 1 and 2 together.

Once the sequence is complete, all existing game saves will be deleted, and when you start the a new game in File 3, you will begin the new secret mission!

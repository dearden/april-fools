The Idaho Potato Commission (IPC) said goodbye to their famous titanic tuber and hello to the newly unveiled, 40-foot long Idaho French Fry Truck. The sudden change of heart (and potato) came as a surprise to potato lovers around the nation who have followed the Truck's journey since the original tour launch in 2012.

 <quote> "What does it take to make the world's largest french fry on wheels? A crane, a pair of lumberjacks using a 2-man tree saw, and three continuous days of peeling," </quote>  said Frank Muir, President & CEO, IPC.  <quote> "Luckily we were able to fashion our french fry just in time for the launch of our 7th National Truck Tour." </quote> 

Once peeled, the 6-ton tater was slowly lowered into an oil-filled, superheated, Olympic-size swimming pool where it cooked for 17 hours straight. After it was finished, 112 bags of road salt were loaded onto a helicopter and sprinkled over the spud.

The smell of the sizzling fry gathered a large crowd of locals around the warehouse eagerly waiting in anticipation as the fry was finally lowered onto the bed of the truck.

 <quote> "Something we didn't foresee was the crowd of hungry onlookers that tried to rip off a piece of our beloved fry," </quote>  said Muir.  <quote> "We were forced to lock up the Truck for two days while the commotion died down, the scents of the french fry disappeared, and our hungry fans got tired of waiting." </quote> 

The first stop on the Truck's 7th National Tour will be in Fries, Virginia at the town's annual Fry Festival. Muir stated that, if eaten, the fry would be able to feed over 8,000 people and go very nicely with a hamburger and milkshake.

 <quote> "Oh, and one more thing," </quote>  said Muir.  <quote> "April Fools!" </quote>

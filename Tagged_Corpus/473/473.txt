After more than 20 years of anticipation and recent reports of Ted Pritchard (best known by the nicknames Thrasher and Thrashpie) mentioning the possibility of returning to the radio industry, a spokesperson has revealed that the long-defunct legendary radio station KNAC Pure Rock will return to terrestrial radio in Los Angeles, California later this year.

The spokesperson, who declined to reveal his name, said,  <quote> “I know many fans have been waiting over 20 years for this. I know I have. It's about time we give a younger generation of metal fans what they deserve” </quote> . Although the spokesperson said that it's unlikely the revamped KNAC will return to its original frequency 105.5-FM, it will  <quote> “definitely be an all-metal and hard rock radio station just like the old KNAC” </quote> , playing music from classic bands like Black Sabbath to Metallica to White Zombie to today's music like Ghost and Steel Panther.

KNAC signed off before 2PM on February 15th, 1995, ending it with Metallica's  <quote> “Fade to Black” </quote> , and it was replaced by the Spanish-language format KBUE (Que Buena). KNAC was resurrected in 1998 as the internet radio station KNAC.com, which still exists to this day.

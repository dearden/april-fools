A tuned up  <quote> “Fast & Furious” </quote>  zoomed to No. 1 at the weekend box office, selling an unexpectedly strong $72.5 million in tickets in North American theaters.

The result – more summer than spring, which is typically a quiet moviegoing period — reignites a film franchise that had been dismissed by Hollywood, if not Universal Pictures, following a disappointing third installment in 2006. That movie,  <quote> “The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,” </quote>  stalled after selling just $62.5 million at domestic theaters, less than half the total of each of its two predecessors,  <quote> “The Fast and the Furious” </quote>  and  <quote> “2 Fast 2 Furious.” </quote> 

But Universal and its financing partner, Relativity Media, decided to place another bet on the street-racing franchise. Research showed that audiences were still keenly interested in Vin Diesel, who moved on after headlining the original  <quote> “The Fast and the Furious.” </quote>  If it could get other members of the original cast to return, Universal figured the audience would turn out for a fourth movie – and bring their kids.

 <quote> “I'm euphoric that our production team had the foresight to do this even though people snickered,” </quote>  said Nikki Rocco, president of Universal Pictures distribution.  <quote> “We saw an opening for a big action movie in April and decided to bite the bullet.” </quote> 

Ms. Rocco said interest across ethnicities helped fuel ticket sales, validating the studio's decision to aggressively pitch the movie to Hispanic audiences. In  <quote> “Fast & Furious,” </quote>  a fugitive ex-con (Mr. Diesel) reluctantly teams up with an FBI agent (Paul Walker) to infiltrate a heroin-importing operation in Mexico and Los Angeles.

Universal's creative team is starting to become known for spotting life in ideas that other industry experts feel have burned out. Last summer, the studio turned  <quote> “Hellboy II: The Golden Army” </quote>  into a hit after Sony Pictures Entertainment passed on making a sequel.

 <quote> “Fast & Furious” </quote>  may have also benefited from a boom in moviegoing that many experts have tied to a need for affordable entertainment during the recession. Total ticket sales for the year are $2.73 billion, a 15 percent increase over the same period last year, according to Media By Numbers, a box office tracking firm. Attendance is up 13 percent.

Last weekend's top movie,  <quote> “Monsters vs. Aliens” </quote>  from DreamWorks Animation, was in second place this weekend. The 3-D movie sold an estimated $33.5 million in tickets, according to Box Office Mojo, for a new domestic total of $105.7 million.

Rounding out the top five were the horror film  <quote> “The Haunting in Connecticut” </quote>  from Lionsgate with an estimated $9.6 million ($37.2 million); the thriller  <quote> “Knowing” </quote>  from Summit Entertainment with an estimated $8.1 million ($58.2 million); and the buddy comedy  <quote> “I Love You, Man” </quote>  from Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks Studios with an estimated $7.9 million ($49.3 million).

The only other movie of note to open over the weekend was  <quote> “Adventureland,” </quote>  a dramatic comedy from Miramax. The low-budget, R-rated picture sold an estimated $6 million in tickets in a medium-sized run in theaters.

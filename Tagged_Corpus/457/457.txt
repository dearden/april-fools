If you're not too concerned about the legality of doing it, you can make a huge pile of money by selling drugs on the dark web. You can also undo all that hard work with a single boneheaded move. That's how things played out for 38-year-old David Ryan Burchard of Merced, California. According to investigators, he managed to rake in more than $1.25 million on the dark web selling marijuana and cocaine.

He started out on Silk Road and moved on to other shady marketplaces in the wake of its highly-publicized shutdown. Burchard wound up on Homeland Security's list of top sellers, though they were having trouble establishing a rock-solid connection between him and his online persona. They knew that Burchard was accumulating a large Bitcoin stash and that there didn't appear to be a legitimate source. Then, finally, investigators got the break they were looking for.

He immediately fired up a web browser and searched the usual locations for a user going by the name caliconnect.

In no time at all he was sifting through reviews on sites like Reddit from other users who had purchased drugs from caliconnect. But wait, it gets weirder. When agents executed a search warrant, they discovered clothing bearing the caliconnect  <quote> “brand” </quote>  at Burchard's residence. That's right. He was planning to sell t-shirts emblazoned with the same username he was using to sell drugs online.

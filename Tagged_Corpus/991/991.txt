1) As threats go,  <quote> “Release the Kraken!” </quote>  pretty much trumps everything else out there.  <quote> “You'll hear from my lawyer!” </quote>  and  <quote> “Don't make me turn this car around!” </quote>  wilt in comparison.

The skyscraper-size, mythical monster is released in this weekend's  <quote> “Clash of the Titans,” </quote>  starring Sam Worthington as Perseus, a warrior on a quest to destroy the gods. A bearded, shimmering Liam Neeson, as head god Zeus, gives the order for the releasing, and as you might imagine, nothing good comes from the beast's liberation. He does not use his strength and size to help his close pals move apartments.

Regardless of how the movie does,  <quote> “Release the Kraken” </quote>  has become a cultish catchphrase. The film's Web site is release-the-kraken.com, and numerous parodies of Neeson bellowing the line have shown up on YouTube, including a heavy-metal remix. There's also the very funny fan-made video  <quote> “Liam and his new pet,” </quote>  in which Zeus (borrowed from trailer footage) keeps phoning a fed-up English guy and pestering him to release the creature.

There's only one question: What the heck is a Kraken anyway?

The short answer is, a gigantic sea monster originating in Norse mythology and often portrayed as looking like a giant squid. That said, there's no real definitive description of the monster.

 <quote> “The Kraken was a bit easier to design than the Hulk, because there was really only one reference known, and that was the original [1981] movie,” </quote>  says  <quote> “Titans” </quote>  character designer Aaron Sims, who also worked on director Louis Leterrier's  <quote> “The Incredible Hulk.” </quote> 

The Kraken in the first movie was created by effects legend Ray Harryhausen, and Sims says he and his team wanted to update the creature's look, while preserving traits from the original in order to please die-hard fans of the earlier  <quote> “Clash.” </quote>  (Sims assures us they exist.)

 <quote> “The Kraken went through several hundred designs,” </quote>  he says.

It began as something similar to the 1981 movie, a green, reptilian monster with four arms. Then it went through a squid phase, in which it was just a mass of tentacles without a head. Then it went through a stage where it was a Frankenstein-esque collection of animal parts.

Finally, it became what ultimately wound up on-screen: a tentacled beast with a turtle-like head and a mouth full of pointy teeth.

 <quote> “The Kraken is summoned from the sea, so you want it to feel like a sea creature,” </quote>  Sims says.  <quote> “I wanted to have tentacles because they could be used as weapons, but there was also some crustacean reference put into the design.” </quote> 

The sharp choppers were meant to recall the ocean's most fearsome creature: Greenpeace.

Or possibly sharks.

Arsenal eye Madrid striker Higuain as Barca try to tempt Van Persie with £15m move

Wanted: Robin van Persie

Arsenal are ready to offer Robin van Persie a new contract to try to ward off interest from Barcelona.

The Gunners are braced for a £15millilion summer bid for the Holland forward and will try to hang on to to the 25-year-old by offering him an improved £70,000 a week.

Barcelona see Van Persie as a long-term replacement for Thierry Henry, who could be off to Manchester City in the summer.

Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, meanwhile, has his eye on Real Madrid's Argentina striker Gonzalo Higuain, according to The People.

Rumors have been floating around for months now that Peter Capaldi will only be staying in the role of the Doctor for one season. Now, those rumors have been confirmed. According to a recent BBC press release, next year we'll be getting a shift similar to the 2010 Davies-Moffat shift. Peter, Jenna, and Steven will all be leaving and will be replaced by Olivia Colman, Colin Morgan, and Mark Gatiss, respectively.

In a surprise move, Colman has been hired to play the first female Doctor alongside a male companion played by the former Merlin star. Their first episode together will be the series 9 opener, set to air in 2015. Production for the season isn't expected to begin for some time, in order to give the new unit time to prepare.

What this means for the future of Sherlock remains to be seen. It is possible that with Moffat's schedule cleared, we could get more new seasons of the show, with fewer breaks in between. However, it will have to be reconciled with Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman's availability.

Moffat said

I'm very sad to be going, but after four years, I think it's time. This has been planned for some time and everyone involved with it was informed last year. It's going to take a load off my plate, as Doctor Who has been consuming most of my life these past few years. Not that I haven't loved it, but there are other things I want to do, more ideas to explore.

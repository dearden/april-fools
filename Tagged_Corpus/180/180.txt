You may have noticed some small changes to Just Creative Design, we've swapped from using Helvetica as our main font, to the much loved Comic Sans. If you don't see the changes press CTRL+F5 to refresh the page.

I feel that it gives the site a much friendlier, fun feel… do you like the new changes? Let me know your comments below.

Network Ten plans to announce that Rove McManus will be stepping aside from his self titled chat show to focus on his production company Roving Enterprises. In his place his longtime sidekick and Triple M host Peter Helliar will take over the show with a new title of ‘Pete'.

The relaunched series is expected to premiere in June. The existing cast will remain. McManus is expected to make occasional appearances but is said to want more time to focus on his relationship and his company.

A close source revealed ‘He is a bit tired of the grind of the show each week and wanted to grow his company'.

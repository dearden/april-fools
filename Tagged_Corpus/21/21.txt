Knowing how much I love pop science, a friend called to discuss something he just read regarding the discovery of a specimen of Papilionoidea ediblitis, known commonly as the Eat-Me Butterfly.

Thought long to have been extinct due to its docile nature and poor flying ability when threatened, this is a significant find for entomologists worldwide. A major contributing factor to its extinction is the fact that the butterfly does not possess chemical defense common to all butterflies, thus it easily falls prey to virtually all predators.

Cindy Janders, department entomologist with the Butterfly Reclamation Program, said in a phone interview from the Amazon jungles,  <quote> "This is a remarkable find. These butterflies are practically defenseless and appeal as a universal food source, making them extremely fragile." </quote> 

The discovering team is still confirming the existence of a colony, but for now the location of this single specimen remains undisclosed. According to the field scientist Edward Schiller,  <quote> "We have high hopes of finding a thriving colony of Eat-Me Butterflies." </quote>  The hopeful Schiller added,  <quote> "Collectors worldwide are counting on us." </quote>

Noel Gallagher has had his trademark indie hairstyle abused by a complete stranger.

The 44-year-old High Flying Birds star - who is currently on tour in America - admits he was left gobsmacked when a man marched up and started insulting his instantly-recognisable hair cut.

He said: ''I'm just stood at some traffic lights waiting to cross the street when a guy slopes up to me.

''He said] 'Hey man I don't mean to disrespect you', (now that usually means you're about to be disrespected) 'but you do realise you got a little 80s thing going on with your hair there? What do you call that style you got?' I was speechless.''

The man then went on to liken Noel's appearance to that of music producer and convicted murderer Phil Spector, who is currently serving 19 years for killing model Lana Clarkson in 2003.

Writing on his blog, the former Oasis rocker continued: ''You look like that ... who was that muh-f***er pro-doocer who shot that bitch in the face? Phil Spector! You look like Phil Spector! (sic)''

Lost for words at the display of rudeness, the 'Don't Look Back in Anger' hitmaker even ended up thanking the man for the insult.

He admitted: ''I don't know why I said thanks.''

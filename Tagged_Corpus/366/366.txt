Yorkshire Eurosceptics can today feel vindicated in their stance after it has been revealed that a new piece of EU legislation could mean the death of The Yorkshire Pudding.

The new EU Labelling Directive will require all member states (including the UK) to  <quote> "provide an accurate product description including an indication of whether the product is a sweet or savoury item" </quote>  - furthermore it prohibits the use of misleading words such as  <quote> "pudding" </quote>  on a savoury product or  <quote> "dinner" </quote>  on a dessert item.

In essence this would mean that labelling mint chocolates as  <quote> "Dinner Mints" </quote>  would be against the law.

But even more disastrous, for Yorkshire it means that our traditional Yorkshire pudding would be required by law to change its name to  <quote> "Yorkshire Savoury" </quote> .

Counting the cost

Unsurprisingly Yorkshire's chefs, restaurateurs and Yorkshire Pudding manufacturers are up in arms. Not only will it mean the loss of identity for Yorkshire's most famous regional dish, but it will mean reprinting menus and redesigning both packaging and adverts.

'a daft bit of nonsense by people in Brussels who have nothing better to do'
For Yorkshire Pudding manufacturers such as Aunt Bessie's and The Real Yorkshire Pudding Company who between them produce over 20 Million Yorkshire Puddings each week, the ramifications could be enormous.

But even for Yorkshire's many restaurants and pubs, who regularly serve the not-so-humble Yorkshire Pud with their Sunday roast, there will be hardships.

 <quote> "Times are hard enough as it is" </quote>  said landlady Iva Butcher from the Cow & Calf pub in Swaledale,  <quote> "we can't afford to reprint all our carvery menus with Yorkshire Savoury instead of Yorkshire Pudding, it's just a daft bit of nonsense by people in Brussels who have nothing better to do." </quote> 

Misguided

The Yorkshire Times' own food writer Fiona Michie thinks the legislation is  <quote> "foolish in the extreme" </quote> . According to Fiona  <quote> "Although the Yorkshire pudding started life as a way to fill up the family, it has become much more than that, a symbol of Yorkshire good sense and thrift and a culinary matter of pride. </quote> 

 <quote> "Essentially it is a form of pancake like the French cr�pe which are often served flamb�ed as a dessert (such as the infamous Cr�pes Suzette) in some of the most exclusive restaurants in Europe. The fact that Yorkshire folk like to cook them in bun dishes and eat them with gravy, shouldn't stop us from calling them Yorkshire Puddings." </quote> 

Indeed many people like to eat their Yorkshires as a dessert. Some simply sprinkle on a little sugar, whilst others really go to town with fruit and cream.

Sign the Save Our Yorkshire Pudding Petition

Unfortunately it seems that EU legislators are unlikely to be swayed by this argument. The draft law goes before the European Parliament this week and if passed will come into force at the start of the next European financial year (1st April 2014).

The Yorkshire Times has today launched a Facebook Petition to try to gain an exemption for The Yorkshire Pudding. Editor-in-chief Richard Trinder said  <quote> "The Yorkshire Pudding is part of Yorkshire's heritage. Having to rename it as a 'Yorkshire Savoury' would be like having to rename 'Big Ben' as  <quote> "Big Clock Tower" </quote> . 2014 will be a huge year for Yorkshire with the Grand D�part and it's a time when we should be making the most of the iconic Yorkshire Pudding not sticking the knife in - unless to eat it of course" </quote> .

The aim is to get 1Million people to sign the Facebook Petition before presenting it to David Cameron at No. 10 later this week. To sign the petition simple 'Like' the Yorkshire Times Facebook page by clicking here.

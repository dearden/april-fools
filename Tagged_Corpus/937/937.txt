Staten Island, NY--OK, I'm not a contemporary country fan. There, I said it. Most of the country music I listen to, which is not a ton, is delivered by artists like Johnny Cash and Merle Haggard. Call me old fashioned. But I just watch Miley Cyrus perform on the Academy of Country Music Awards, and um, can some one please tell me why this girl is great?

I know I'm gonna get flack for this, because Miley Cyrus fans are everywhere. But she was out of tune, wasn't she? And she flung her hair around way too much. The song she sang was cheesey as all get out, which I sort of expect. She was singing something about climbing/moving mountains as a weird hydraulic platform lifted her far above her rock band clad all in white. And then a giant cascade of sparks for the finale, with her reaching for some note and screeching something about  <quote> "keeping the faith." </quote>  What's the expression... <quote> "gag me" </quote> ?

Now I'm watching Carrie Underwood sing, and though my esteemed editor Rob Bailey does not share the same love for Ms. Underwood as I do, she seems so much better as an artist and singer. No wonder she just won  <quote> "Top Female Vocalist" </quote>  just now.

Also, Reba McEntire seems to be doing pretty well. She's funny, and has some of that more  <quote> "real" </quote>  quality. Like she's done a few more things than just whiten her teeth.

This performance of  <quote> "Till The Last Shot's Fired" </quote>  with the Westpoint Glee Club Choir and Trace Adkins was pretty powerful. I feel like most major awards since we went to Iraq have had some sort of salute to the troops or recognition of their sacrifice abroad. I think that's a good thing.

What are your CMA impressions? Good show this year? Tell me what you think.

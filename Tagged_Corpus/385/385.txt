Move over, K-9…there's a new four-legged companion coming to the TARDIS!

Peter Capaldi's love of classic Doctor Who has shone through once again, as the actor has convinced the show's bosses to give his Doctor a new companion similar to that famous  <quote> “tin dog” </quote> .

The new companion will be a cyborg cat, inventively named  <quote> “Fuzz-E” </quote> .  He will make his debut in a New Year's Special and will be a recurring character in series nine and beyond.

The top-secret special may also see the return of several beloved characters, including K-9.  There are whispers that Tom Baker is being wooed to make an appearance as The Curator (hot off his scene in The Day of the Doctor), possibly finding Fuzz-E timelocked in an ancient Time Lord etching.  If Baker is unable to appear, Ninth Doctor actor Christopher Eccleston—himself the owner of several dozen cats–is almost certain to return.

Fuzz-E will be portrayed by feline actor Peter Catapaldi, with CGI robotic parts added later.  He will be voiced by a succession of music stars, including George Michael, Miley Cyrus, and  <quote> “various” </quote>  members of One Direction, as most of the cat's dialogue will be sung, due to a  <quote> “malfunctioning” </quote>  voice chip.  When asked about the show's new four-legged companion, big man Steven Moffat had this to say:

 <quote> “Fuzz-E will go boldly where no cat has, er, ever gone before.  Bold!  Cat!  …Scotland rocks!” </quote> 

The New Year's special, tentatively titled  <quote> “The Night of the Animal Doctor” </quote> , is scheduled for broadcast on BBC One and Animal Planet on January 1st.  The rumored story involves Fuzz-E saving the Twelfth Doctor from near disaster as he mistakenly lands the TARDIS on Earth during April Fool's Day.

Forget Oblivion on the XBox360 and PC. The Nintendo DS is about to get its own The Elder Scrolls.
Bethesda states that the The Elder Scrolls: Anthology will feature three games in one. The first two are direct ports of the original Arena and Daggerfall which were released on the PC platform and will be played in GBA-mode (read: you'll only get one screen to play the game on, without any touchscreen-controls), while the third title in the set is an entirely new adventure designed specifically for the DS, by the name of The Elder Scrolls Travels: Elswyr.

The Elder Scrolls Travels: Elswyr is brand new adventure featuring a fully realized and unique Elder Scrolls world set in the province of Elswyr, home of the cat-like Khajit. Elswyr will be controlled in a manner equal to one of the control schemes introduced in Metroid Prime Hunters. Movement is conducted using the touchscreen, while all activities (like jumping, hack'n'slashing and interacting with NPC's) are done using the L and R buttons plus either the D-pad or the A, B, C and Y buttons (if you're left-handed). Using the touchscreen, it is also possible to select different magic spells or access your inventory.

The game world will be roughly half the size of that in Oblivion and will feature landscapes in settings including jungles, tree-top tribes, volcanic wastelands, and frozen mountains. The lack of horses, due both to programming restraints involving the use of the touchscreen and the fact that horses are not native to the Elswyr continent, will allow players to walk around for hours in the huge world.

According to Bethesda representative John Fulling, The Elder Scrolls: Anthology has been in production for over a year now, and is slated for a release in Q1 2007. The first screens should arrive in roughly a month, during the E3 event in May.

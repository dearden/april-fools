A statement from the US Embassy said the unmanned, unarmed MQ-9 Reaper aircraft crashed near the Seychelles International Airport Runway on Wednesday, causing no injuries.

The Seychelles Civil Aviation Authority (SCAA) said that the drone developed technical problems soon after take off and needed to land quickly. The remotely-piloted drone tried to land but was unable to and crashed.

This was the second US aircraft to crash near the Seychelles airport and career into the Indian Ocean.

The first drone went down on the East African archipelago on December 13. The crash caused no injuries and the airport was reopened for normal traffic within minutes.

Local officials said the American drones based in Seychelles are used to track pirates in and around the Indian Ocean. The aircrafts are usually unarmed, although they are capable of carrying weapons.

A classified US diplomatic cable dated 2009 revealed that the aircraft performed missions over Somalia and the Horn of Africa from the Seychelles.

The US has used drones in the past to hunt for al-Qaeda militants in Somalia and Yemen, among other countries.

There is a small US military team stationed in the Seychelles to operate the drone programme.

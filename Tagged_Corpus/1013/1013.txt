'Instant vomit' ... Rachel Ward and Richard Chamberlain in The Thorn Birds.

Acclaimed Australian author Colleen McCullough hopes a British musical production of her best-selling romance novel The Thorn Birds will be a vast improvement on the TV mini series version.

McCullough has travelled to Britain from her Norfolk Island home to put the finishing touches on the musical that she has been working on for the past 15 years.

She said while the 1983 TV version, which starred Bryan Brown, Rachel Ward and Richard Chamberlain, was a ratings hit, she never liked it.

 <quote> "It was instant vomit," </quote>  McCullough told The Mail on Sunday newspaper.

 <quote> "Ward couldn't act her way out of a paper bag and Chamberlain wandered about all wet and wide-eyed.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "The filming was done in Hawaii, there was only one kangaroo on the set and everyone sounded American except Bryan Brown, whose Oz accent stuck out like a dingo's bits." </quote> 

McCullough released The Thorn Birds novel, an epic love story of a Catholic priest and a woman in the Australian outback, in 1977.

The musical is being produced by The Wales Theatre Company.

Australian feminist and academic Germaine Greer has recently criticised McCullough for failing to include aborigines in The Thorn Birds.

McCullough defended her work, saying:  <quote> "Poor old Germs! She's just currying favour with the politically correct.

 <quote> "Listen. In the book I am painting a picture of life as it was for white people in the first half of the 20th century. Believe me, to them the Abo would have been invisible." </quote> 

The musical version opened in Swansea last week and will tour Wales and England until mid July.

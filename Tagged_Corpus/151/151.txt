Kaleb Nation, the genius behind the Twi-Guy phenomenon, is no stranger to literature or the internet. This amazing, multi-talented gentleman started writing at a young age. At only fourteen years of age – FOURTEEN – his brilliant mind came up with the concept and story of Bran Hambric. Through hard work and dedicated perseverance, he managed to write his story and has already signed with one of New York's leading literary agencies. Look for the first of what we are sure will be dozens of number one best sellers to be on the shelf in your local book store in the fall of this year.

If that wasn't enough to make you swoon, Kaleb started in the media at an even earlier age. He was thirteen when he started his own radio show and then later went on to become one of the youngest nationally syndicated hosts on the air. What an accomplishment!

But wait – there's more! He started his first website to provide web and print graphics for clients all over the U.S., but found an even bigger home when he launched the TwilightGuy.com blog. His chapter by chapter run down offers up that rarely seen and oh-so-valuable male perspective on the series. His wit, comedy, insight, and the fact that readers came back week by week to hopefully catch a glimpse of his gorgeous eyes peeking out from behind his book made him one of the most popular Twilight fans on the web!

From his YouTube videos to the time he spent on the red carpet, we just can't get enough of Kaleb Nation! Move over Edward… Kaleb is the one to watch!

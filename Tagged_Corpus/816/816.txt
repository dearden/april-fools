Sandra Bullock is done with cheating-hubby Jesse James and has prepared divorce papers, RadarOnline reported Monday.

There's no indication if and when she'll actually file for a legal split, but the Oscar-winning mega-star is contemplating her next step now that James has been outed as a serial philanderer.

The pair apparently has a prenuptial agreement that stipulates James gets no money if he's caught having extra-marital affairs, the Web site reported.

Yet Bullock's Hollywood fortune isn't on her mind.

James was seeking help for sex addiction at Sierra Tucson but has since bailed from the Arizona facility, and he has been trying to contact the  <quote> "Blind Side" </quote>  star.

But Bullock wants nothing to do with the TV gear head. Instead, she has surrounded herself with security.

 <quote> "Her attitude toward Jesse hasn't softened since she found out he was cheating on her," </quote>  RadarOnline.com reports a source as saying.  <quote> "She's been betrayed and cheated on and she's not getting over that." </quote> 

Moving vans were spotting at the couple's California home late last week, hauling away furniture and boxes.

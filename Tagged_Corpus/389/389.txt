SAN FRANCISCO—Secret plans to offer zeppelin based  <quote> “home delivery" </quote>  service were leaked on Sunday when a trial run was photographed by a local birdwatcher.

The photograph above, examined by experts in digital photography manipulation clearly shows a full-sized  <quote> “Not So Big House” </quote>  by architect and bestselling author Sarah Susanka transported beneath a zeppelin airship high above the Siskiyou Mountains in Northern California.

The affectionately named  <quote> “454-6” </quote>  makes an ideal  <quote> “home-delivery” </quote>  due to its  <quote> “not so big” </quote>  size and sturdy brick foundation.

 <quote> “It just makes a ton of sense,” </quote>  said Luther Mandible, the local hiker and birder who discovered the trial delivery when reviewing photos taken yesterday near Goosenest.   <quote> “Ever since I started using Amazon, I knew it would come to this.  I've bought all kinds of stuff that gets delivered in a day or two, why not a new house?” </quote> 

The first recorded prefab home, shipped from England to Massachusetts in 1670 avoided the current  <quote> “just doesn't fit through the tunnel” </quote>  challenge faced by todays prefabricated homebuilders.  Now, flying at extremely low speeds and at low altitude, Houseplans can deliver a complete home anywhere that has a sky.

Reached for a comment architect Sarah Susanka told reporters  <quote> "I am delighted that Houseplans discovered yet another advantage of the Not So Big House.   Along with offering a wonderful, warm, home designed perfectly for the way you live, they are portable by airship.” </quote> 

After repeated calls for confirmation, Houseplans owner Stephen Williamson conceded that  <quote> “Houseplans has the largest collection of ready-made home plans in all styles and sizes, including plans from world-famous architects and residential designers.” </quote>   Pressed to talk about the flying house Williamson added,  <quote> “I was the President and CEO of Odwalla, the fresh juice company.  We shipped our juice in our own trucks, why not do the same with houses? Besides, zeppelins are cooler than step vans.” </quote>

According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, the current average cost of a factory-built home is about $30.00 per square foot of living area roughly half of the cost of traditional  <quote> “stick-built” </quote>  homes that run $80.00 per square foot in some parts of remote Arkansas.

 <quote> “We can build the house in Arkansas, ‘Zep' it to the Hamptons, save millions of dollars and invite our friends to share the 4 week flight” </quote>  suggested a famous blogger and interior decorator who requested anonymity.

 <quote> “By this time next year, the skies should be full of zeppelins carrying houses” </quote>  offered the impronounceably named Arend Spaeth, GM of Houseplans‘ home delivery operations.   <quote> “Our goal is to literally blot out the sky as we bring architecture to everyone” </quote> 

Factory built home advocates around the world hope that Spaeth is right, but others worry that zeppelin delivery could open a new round of alternative house transportation using decommissioned flying vehicles.

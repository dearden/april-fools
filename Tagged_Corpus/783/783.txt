Waqar Younis has resigned as the Pakistan coach following his side's disappointing performances in the World Twenty20 in India and the Asia Cup in Bangladesh.

Waqar is the latest to step down from his role with the country following the captain Shahid Afridi's resignation as the T20 captain. The Pakistan team manager, Intikhab Alam, had called Afridi  <quote> “absolutely clueless in terms of on-field tactics and off-field leadership” </quote>  in a report.

Waqar had offered to step down last Tuesday, saying he would  <quote> “literally put [his] hands together and beg for forgiveness” </quote> . He has now ended his second term as the Pakistan coach, after being appointed in 2014 following another stint in charge between 2010 and 2011.

Pakistan won only three of the eight games they played at the World Twenty20 and the Asia Cup and Waqar wrote a highly critical report of how the team was performing which was leaked. In it, he attacked the PCB for not allowing him input on squad selection and he was also disparaging as to Afridi's captaincy.

 <quote> “I am resigning from my post today with a heavy heart,” </quote>  said Waqar, before referring to his report.  <quote> “I want my recommendations to be implemented. They were not acted on when I first made them in 2015.” </quote>

Bayern Munich's hangover after clinching the league title in record time continued with a 1-0 loss at Augsburg, ending its record 53-match unbeaten streak in the Bundesliga. The loss also marked the first time it has been held scoreless in 65 league matches. According to WhoScored, the last time this happened was April 14, 2012 against Mainz.

Prior to the match, Bayern manager Pep Guardiola said,  <quote> "The Bundesliga is over for us. Our target is the Champions League." </quote>  He emphasized that point by giving 19-year-olds Mitchell Weiser and Ylli Sallahi and 18-year-old Pierre Hojbjerg their first career starts. Backup goalkeeper Tom Starke was also scheduled to start, but he tore a ligament in his elbow during training on Friday. So after the match, Guardiola didn't seem too broken up about the result.

From the AP:

 <quote> "That's football, that's sport," </quote>  Bayern coach Pep Guardiola said.  <quote> "You can't always win. There was going to be a loss sooner or later." </quote> 

After a draw against Hoffenheim, a draw against Man United in the first leg of their Champions League quarterfinal and now the loss to Augsburg, Bayern's focus returns to the lame-duck Premier League champions.

With a bit of rest and its annual loss out of the way, Bayern will be looking to refocus its efforts and take a step toward the next trophy on its checklist.

A Twickenham mum's addiction to alcohol and a career in porn saw her play  <quote> "Russian roulette" </quote>  with her life, but she regrets none of it as her experiences are helping her educate youngsters.

Recovered alcoholic Lianne Young believes her past  <quote> "mistakes" </quote>  have given her the confidence to talk to today's younger generation about alcohol misuse and sex education.

Lianne started drinking when she was 10 because she did not get on with her family and found it gave her confidence around other people.

She said:  <quote> "It was about being a rebel, having a fake ID at 12 and being banned from bars by the time I was 13.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "The mistakes I made while drunk were ridiculous - having casual sex and not thinking twice. I was a nutter, Drew Barrymore had nothing on me," </quote>  she added.

Lianne boozed daily throughout her teens and at 15 was told by doctors she was doing herself serious harm. She stopped drinking for six months but quickly returned to the habit.

At 24, and still drinking regularly, Lianne decided to use her booze-fuelled confidence to make more money in the world of adult entertainment.

For four years she lived a life of  <quote> "A-list parties," </quote>  frequent flights between London and Los Angeles and trips to the Playboy mansion.

 <quote> "I was having wild sex while drunk. Some people knew me as the dirtiest, hardest porn star, I was called the porn queen of England," </quote>  Lianne said.

She left the industry when she was 28 and at 30 - when she claims she  <quote> "looked about 50" </quote>  - decided it was time to turn her life around.

Lianne said:  <quote> "It sunk in that I was a mother and could not carry on doing this. I had lost all my TV jobs and there were no more offers of work." </quote> 

She turned to Richmond's Addiction Support and Care Agency (ASCA) for help and rehabilitation.

Lianne described the process as being cracked like a nut and opening up.

 <quote> "I don't know how I managed to get through but now I've changed my whole life around. I do not regret anything I've done as I can pass on what I've learnt.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "There aren't enough confident adults talking to the young generation - I want to talk to the kids about it," </quote>  she said.

Lianne, now 33, who has two teenage children, plans to work with the Family Planning Association to teach sex education and offer advice, based on her experiences, to the younger generation.

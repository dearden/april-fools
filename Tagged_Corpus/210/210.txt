Clippy Makes A Comeback With Office 2010

Beta testing indicates users miss paperclip pal

AUCKLAND, New Zealand — Embargoed until 6am, 1 April, 2010 — Following an extensive beta testing period, Microsoft is considering reintroducing the animated Office Assistant – fondly nicknamed Clippy – to the latest version of the Office 2010 productivity suite.

Usability testing and reporting indicates that customers miss the helpful interactive character that would appear to offer assistance with common tasks in Microsoft Word, such as letter writing or list making. Clippy was last incorporated in the 2003 version of Microsoft Office.

The applications haven't been the same without him,” </quote>  says Anne Taylor, Information Worker Business Group Manager, Microsoft New Zealand.  <quote> “Feedback gathered by our product team indicates that many users share a common sentiment to see him return. We're asking the public to help us decide.” </quote> 

Microsoft New Zealand has put together an online poll to gather further opinion on re-integrating Clippy into the local version of the Office 2010 release when it is launched. Users are encouraged to visit www.microsoft.co.nz/roadwarriors and register their feedback. The poll is also available on the Facebook pages of the Microsoft Office 2010 Road Warriors, who will solicit further input from the field.

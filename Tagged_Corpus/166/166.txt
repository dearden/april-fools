A remake of the 80's hit Back to the Future is in perfect hands as it was announced that it will be directed by one of the original trilogy's producers, Steven Spielberg. And who better to fill the shoes of the young time traveler Marty McFly then his golden boy Shia LaBeouf.

Spielberg took the time to make this announcement himself to quell any fear some of us loyal Back to the Future fans may have, and he said he will be very true to the original, besides the stuff that he decides to change. It will be updated for modern day, and so the time machine will  <quote> "most likely take the form of a Hybrid of some sort. If you're going to time travel today, you're going to have to be green about it," </quote>  Spielberg said in his announcement.

But the big question is who will step into the eccentric, 1.21 jiggawatt fueled shows of Dr. Emmett L. Brown? Spielberg saves that for last as he says, none other than Johnny Depp will step into the shoes once filled by Christopher Lloyd. It took some real convicing according to Spielberg, but it was the money that got him. Real pirates gold from what I'm told. And finally, one more thing, who's taking on the role of big buff meathead Biff Tannen? None other than the muscle man himself Vin Diesel. I simply cannot wait to see this come together.

The announcement video is over at Spielberg's official site. What do you guys think?

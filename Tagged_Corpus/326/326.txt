The ink may still be drying on their break-up announcement, but do Jet have one parting shot left?

In the vein of R.E.M., who released a career-spanning retrospective just days after calling it quits, the cover art and a tracklisting for a mysterious album called Monkey Off Our Back has turned up on Amazon.

While the link has since been removed, we've managed to save a copy of the cover, which appears to take the piss out of Pitchfork's i”nfamous “review of second album Shine On, which received a 0.0 rating and featured a clip of a monkey urinating in its own mouth.

According to the Amazon listing, the two-disc retrospective will include Jet hits such as Are You Gonna Be My Girl, Rollover DJ, Cold Hard Bitch, Look What You've Done and Get Me Outta Here from their multi-platinum debut, as well as a sprinkling of songs from Shine On and final album Shaka Rock. The second disc will feature rarities and “lost A-sides”, taken from the Get Born sessions in Los Angeles.

While the album has yet to be officially endorsed by Jet or their in-house label Real Horrorshow Records, a source close to the band has confirmed its legitimacy. They said the cover of the monkey pissing was a bit of fun, but was also about “reclaiming” the image from their antagonists.

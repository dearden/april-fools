Haye has also ruled out staying around in the division to make multiple defences.

There was clause in the Haye-Valuev contract last November for an option of a re-match, and although Haye wishes to fight either of the Klitschkos  <quote> “as soon as possible” </quote> , Hayemaker will take the fight, according to Booth,  <quote> “which makes most business sense” </quote> .

The promise of a  <quote> “dramatic” </quote>  denouement from Haye in his first defence of the World Boxing Association heavyweight title was duly delivered when he stopped proud challenger John Ruiz after nine dominant rounds at the MEN Arena, Manchester.

In a brutal dance, Haye had Ruiz down four times before the fight was stopped in the ninth by referee Guillermo Perez, as Miguel Diaz in the American's corner waved a white towel over the ropes.

Haye won all but one of the rounds, slowly dismantling the challenger with power punches.

Haye said:  <quote> "I was over the moon with the performance, really happy with it. Although I was caught a few times, I felt really sharp.
 </quote> 
 <quote> “There were a load of fans here. The crowd has been absolutely electric for me. There was a capacity crowd with everyone screaming the 'Hayemaker'. With performances like that I'll keep the fans behind me. I loved the whole occasion." </quote> 

Booth, Haye's trainer, added that he was satisfied with his charge's performance, but did grow concerned when the champion took unnecessary punches.

 <quote> "David's got a good boxing brain," </quote>  he said.  <quote> "He gave an entertaining fight in a homecoming. But I don't like it when David takes shots he doesn't need to take. Boxing is ‘hit and not be hit'.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "We don't know what the immediate future holds, who David's next opponent will be. We will take the fight that makes the most sense…that could even be (Nikolai) Valuev.” </quote> 

Haye's performance will have had the rest of the heavyweight division - and potentially the US television market - watching and nodding in approval.

In retaining his WBA heavyweight title, Haye remains on track for both retirement in two years' time and, before that, lucrative super-fights with the Klitschko brothers, an end game he has been plotting for more than two years.

Haye said:  <quote> "The Klitschkos, all their careers, have fought guys who are clearly overweight, out of shape, happy to keep getting a payday.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "This Albert Sosnowski guy, Audley was favourite to beat him, then he gets a title shot (against Vitali). You can understand him. He's in it for the business, but Vitali was talking about Valuev, then that never materialised. Now he's fighting this Sosnowski guy.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "His career is littered with guys like that, who he's clearly going to beat very easily. So I don't really pay him that much attention. Valuev wouldn't be as easy as Vitali thinks." </quote> 

Dan Goosen, who promotes Eddie Chambers, beaten by Wladimir Klitschko in Dusseldorf two weeks ago, has said the likes of Haye, and the smaller heavyweights, will struggle against the size of the Klitschkos.

Haye, though, strongly disagrees.

 <quote> "Corrie Sanders was the same size as me. He knocked Wladimir out," </quote>  said Haye.  <quote> "Chris Byrd beat Vitali. Ross Purrity knocked Wladimir out. Lamon Brewster knocked out Wladimir. So the guys who beat them have been small heavyweights. They're both very beatable.” </quote> 

Haye's self-belief is iron-clad, and he will need it to unify the belts. If he can do so, it will be the end, according to Haye.

Holding on to the title, or titles, and making numerous defences, he claims, is not in the grand plan. Out at the age of 31. No long-term damage to his head.

Haye said:  <quote> "I don't think I could squeeze in half a dozen (defences), to be honest.
 </quote> 
 <quote> "My whole plan is just to become the No 1, undisputed heavyweight in the world. Having defences against the (Albert) Sosnowskis or (Eddie) Chambers or anyone like that - who are the only other guys really out there at the moment - is not going to add to my legacy." </quote>

WAYNE'S World and Wayne's World's 2 star Tia Carrere has filed for divorce - her second busted marriage - and says she's in the  <quote> "happiest place in the world" </quote> .

Carrere, 43, of The Relic Hunter and fondly remembered for her sexy dance in 1994 film True Lies, started proceedings in Los Angeles Superior Court to end her seven-year marriage to a British photojournalist.

According to court documents, which Tia filed herself, she has cited irreconcilable differences with her husband, Simon Wakelin.

The couple have a four-year-old daughter, Bianca, together and the 43-year-old actress is asking for sole physical custody of the child.

This is the second marriage to end in divorce for Carrere, who split from producer Elie Samaha in 2000.

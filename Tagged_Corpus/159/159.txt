Eric Mangini, the new Cleveland Browns Head Coach, asked Brett Favre to come to camp to coach his two battling quarterbacks Brady Quinn and Derek Anderson.
Contract Controversy

After watching a week of throwing and mechanics from both Quinn and Anderson, Favre either had an epiphany or completely lost it. Brett called the New York Jets, paid them a ridiculous sum of money to release him and the very next day came running out of the Cleveland locker room in shoulder pads wearing a #4 Browns Jersey.

I don't know what's more insane; that Mangini called Favre for help, that Favre thinks he can win the quarterback battle in Cleveland or that the Cleveland Browns Press staff already released this statement about Favre's return to the NFL:

This morning the Cleveland Browns are proud to announce that Brett Favre will be our starting quarterback for the 2009 NFL season. We are happy to have Brett join our franchise and know that he can lead the Browns in the right direction.

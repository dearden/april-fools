The group, WikiLeaks, claims it acquired encrypted video of the July 12, 2007, attack from military whistleblowers and had been able to view and investigate it after breaking the encryption code.

A US defense official later confirmed that the video and audio were authentic.

The helicopter gunsight video, with an audio track of talking between the fliers, shows an aerial view of a group of men moving about a square in a Baghdad neighborhood. The fliers identify some of the men as armed. The video shows a street in Baghdad and a group of about eight people, identified as insurgents. They are then shot dead by the Apache's cannon. When a van drives onto the scene, and begins to pick up the wounded, it too is fired upon.

The audio is of the pilots' radio transmissions and of US troops on the ground.

WikiLeaks said the men in the square include Reuters photographer Namir Noor-Eldeen, 22, and his assistant and driver Saeed Chmagh, 40, who were killed in the incident although it has not been confirmed if the journalists were in the footage.

The gunsight tracks the two Reuters news staff as the fliers identify their cameras as weapons.

The helicopter initially opens fire on the small group. Minutes later a van comes by, and starts assisting the wounded, and the helicopter opens fire on the van.

David Schlesinger, Reuters' editor in chief, said of the video released by WikiLeaks that the deaths of the journalists were  <quote> "tragic and emblematic of the extreme dangers that exist in covering war zones." </quote>

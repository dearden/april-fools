PRAGUE, Czech Republic (CNN) -- President Obama urged nations Sunday to get rid of nuclear weapons, saying that the U.S. is committed to reducing nuclear stocks within the next four years.

President Barack Obama faces a large crowd Sunday near the Prague Castle in the Czech Republic.

 <quote> "Nuclear weapons are the most dangerous legacies of the Cold War," </quote>  Obama said in a speech in front of a huge crowd outside the medieval Prague Castle in the Czech Republic.  <quote> "The U.S. will take concrete steps. ... We will begin the work of reducing our arsenals and stockpiles." </quote> 

The president, who was on an eight-day visit to Europe, warned that if some nations defy orders to get rid of nuclear weapons, America will maintain a safe and secure nuclear capability  <quote> "to deter our adversaries and reassure our allies." </quote> 

Obama said that the United States will need help to reach its goal, adding that talks are under way with his Russian counterpart.

 <quote> "President [Dmitry] Medvedev and I began this process in London, and we will seek to include all nuclear weapon states in this endeavor." </quote> 

Obama added,  <quote> "To enhance our security and to demonstrate U.S. commitment to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, we will negotiate a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with Russia by the end of the year." </quote> 

The president said that the solutions will include preventing the production of more nuclear weapons, negotiating a new international treaty and strengthening the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

He warned that countries that break the rules will face immediate consequences, including automatic referral to the U.N. Security Council.

 <quote> "Some argue that the spread of these weapons cannot be stopped," </quote>  Obama said.  <quote> "Such fatalism is a deadly adversary. If we believe that, then we are admitting that the use of nuclear weapons is inevitable." </quote> 

Obama's speech came on the same day that North Korea launched a long-range rocket, which was widely condemned by U.S. and international officials, including U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

 <quote> "Given the volatility in the region as well as a stalemate in interaction among the concerned parties such a launch is not conducive to efforts to promote dialogue, regional peace and stability," </quote>  Ban said through a spokesman.

Obama said North Korea's launch emphasizes the urgency of the denuclearization agenda and also warned Iran that it had a choice on its nuclear ambitions.

 <quote> "We will present a clear choice to Iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations, including its right to peaceful nuclear energy,or continue to refuse to meet its international obligations," </quote>  he said. Watch as Obama condemns North Korea's move Â»

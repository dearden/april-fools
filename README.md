# april-fools
Code submission to go alongside paper: "Foolâ€™s Errand: Looking at April Fools Hoaxes as Disinformation through the Lens of Deception and Humour".

Contained in the "System" folder is the code we used to gather features and create feature tables.

The "Analyses" folder contains the jupyter-notebooks that were used during analysis.

We have created a folder called "Notebooks for Final Paper" which contains notebooks which contain the code used in the paper for classification, logistic regression weights, and making density plots.

If you follow these notebooks, it should be simple to reproduce our results.

We've also provided our corpus, complete with frequency lists produced by the CLAWS PoS tagger and the USAS Semantic Tagger.
